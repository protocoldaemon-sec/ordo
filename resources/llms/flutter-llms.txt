[vertical\_align\_topConfiguring the URL strategy on the web](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation/url-strategies#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Flutter web apps support two ways of configuring
URL-based navigation on the web:


**Hash (default)**

Paths are read and written to the [hash fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator#Syntax).


For example, `flutterexample.dev/#/path/to/screen`.

**Path**

Paths are read and written without a hash. For example,

`flutterexample.dev/path/to/screen`.

## Configuring the URL strategy

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation/url-strategies#configuring-the-url-strategy)

To configure Flutter to use the path instead, use the
[usePathUrlStrategy](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_web_plugins/usePathUrlStrategy.html)
function provided by the [flutter\_web\_plugins](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_web_plugins/flutter_web_plugins-library.html)
library,
which is part of the Flutter SDK.


You can't directly add `flutter_web_plugins` using `pub add`.
Include it as a Flutter [SDK dependency](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#sdk)
in your `pubspec.yaml` file:


yaml

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_web_plugins:
    sdk: flutter
```

content\_copy

Then call the `usePathUrlStrategy` function before `runApp`:

dart

```
import 'package:flutter_web_plugins/url_strategy.dart';
​
void main() {
  usePathUrlStrategy();
  runApp(ExampleApp());
}
```

content\_copy

## Configuring your web server

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation/url-strategies#configuring-your-web-server)

PathUrlStrategy uses the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API), which requires additional
configuration for web servers.


To configure your web server to support PathUrlStrategy, check your web server's
documentation to rewrite requests to `index.html`. Check your web server's
documentation for details on how to configure single-page apps.


If you are using Firebase Hosting, choose the "Configure as a single-page app"
option when initializing your project. For more information see Firebase's
[Configure rewrites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#rewrites)
documentation.


The local dev server created by running `flutter run -d chrome` is configured to
handle any path gracefully and fallback to your app's `index.html` file.


## Hosting a Flutter app at a non-root location

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation/url-strategies#hosting-a-flutter-app-at-a-non-root-location)

Update the `<base href="/">` tag in `web/index.html`
to the path where your app is hosted.
For example, to host your Flutter app at
`my_app.dev/flutter_app`, change
this tag to `<base href="/flutter_app/">`.


Relative `base href` tags are supported for release builds but they must take
into account the full URL where the page was served from.
This means a relative `base href` for a request to `/flutter_app/`,
`/flutter_app/nested/route`, and `/flutter_app/nested/route/`
will be different
(for example `"."`, `".."`, and `"../.."` respectively).

## Add the VS Code extensions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/vscode#add-the-vs-code-extensions)

To use the DevTools from VS Code, you need the [Dart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code).
If you're debugging Flutter applications, you should also install
the [Flutter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter).


## Start an application to debug

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/vscode#run-and-debug)

Start a debug session for your application by opening the root
folder of your project (the one containing `pubspec.yaml`)
in VS Code and clicking **Run > Start Debugging** (`F5`).


## Launch DevTools

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/vscode#launch-devtools)

Once the debug session is active and the application has started,
the **Open DevTools** commands become available in the
VS Code command palette (`F1`):


![Screenshot showing Open DevTools commands](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/vs-code/vscode_command.png)

The chosen tool will be opened embedded inside VS Code.

![Screenshot showing DevTools embedded in VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/vs-code/vscode_embedded.png)

You can choose to have DevTools always opened
in a browser with the `dart.embedDevTools` setting,
and control whether it opens as a full window or
in a new column next to your current editor with the
`dart.devToolsLocation` setting.


A full list of Dart/Flutter settings are available on
[dartcode.org](https://dartcode.org/docs/settings/)
or in the
[VS Code settings editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-editor).
Some recommendation settings for Dart/Flutter in VS Code
can also be found on
[dartcode.org](https://dartcode.org/docs/recommended-settings/).


You can also see whether DevTools is running
and launch it in a browser from the language status area
(the `{}` icon next to **Dart** in the status bar).

[vertical\_align\_topInternationalizing Flutter apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

If your app might be deployed to users who speak another
language then you'll need to internationalize it.
That means you need to write the app in a way that makes
it possible to localize values like text and layouts
for each language or locale that the app supports.
Flutter provides widgets and classes that help with
internationalization and the Flutter libraries
themselves are internationalized.


This page covers concepts and workflows necessary to
localize a Flutter application using the
`MaterialApp` and `CupertinoApp` classes,
as most apps are written that way.
However, applications written using the lower level
`WidgetsApp` class can also be internationalized
using the same classes and logic.


## Introduction to localizations in Flutter

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#introduction-to-localizations-in-flutter)

This section provides a tutorial on how to create and
internationalize a new Flutter application,
along with any additional setup
that a target platform might require.


You can find the source code for this example in
[`gen_l10n_example`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/internationalization/gen_l10n_example).


### Setting up an internation­alized app: the Flutter\_localizations package

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#setting-up)

By default, Flutter only provides US English localizations.
To add support for other languages,
an application must specify additional
`MaterialApp` (or `CupertinoApp`) properties,
and include a package called `flutter_localizations`.


To begin, start by creating a new Flutter application
in a directory of your choice with the `flutter create` command.


```
$ flutter create <name_of_flutter_app>
```

content\_copy

To use `flutter_localizations`,
add the package as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file,
as well as the `intl` package:


```
$ flutter pub add flutter_localizations --sdk=flutter
$ flutter pub add intl:any
```

content\_copy

This creates a `pubspec.yml` file with the following entries:

yaml

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter
  intl: any
```

content\_copy

Then import the `flutter_localizations` library and specify
`localizationsDelegates` and `supportedLocales` for
your `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`:


dart

```
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';
```

content\_copy

dart

```
return const MaterialApp(
  title: 'Localizations Sample App',
  localizationsDelegates: [\
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,\
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,\
    GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,\
  ],
  supportedLocales: [\
    Locale('en'), // English\
    Locale('es'), // Spanish\
  ],
  home: MyHomePage(),
);
```

content\_copy

After introducing the `flutter_localizations` package
and adding the previous code,
the `Material` and `Cupertino`
packages should now be correctly localized in
one of the supported locales.
Widgets should be adapted to the localized messages,
along with correct left-to-right or right-to-left layout.


Try switching the target platform's locale to
Spanish (`es`) and the messages should be localized.


Apps based on `WidgetsApp` are similar except that the
`GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate` isn't needed.


The full `Locale.fromSubtags` constructor is preferred
as it supports [`scriptCode`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/package-intl_locale/Locale/scriptCode.html), though the
`Locale` default
constructor is still fully valid.


The elements of the `localizationsDelegates` list are
factories that produce collections of localized values.
`GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate` provides localized
strings and other values for the Material Components
library. `GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate`
defines the default text direction,
either left-to-right or right-to-left, for the widgets library.


More information about these app properties, the types they
depend on, and how internationalized Flutter apps are typically
structured, is covered on this page.


### Overriding the locale

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#overriding-the-locale)

`Localizations.override` is a factory constructor
for the `Localizations` widget that allows for
(the typically rare) situation where a section of your application
needs to be localized to a different locale than the locale
configured for your device.


To observe this behavior, add a call to `Localizations.override`
and a simple `CalendarDatePicker`:


dart

```
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(title: Text(widget.title)),
    body: Center(
      child: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: <Widget>[\
          // Add the following code\
          Localizations.override(\
            context: context,\
            locale: const Locale('es'),\
            // Using a Builder to get the correct BuildContext.\
            // Alternatively, you can create a new widget and Localizations.override\
            // will pass the updated BuildContext to the new widget.\
            child: Builder(\
              builder: (context) {\
                // A toy example for an internationalized Material widget.\
                return CalendarDatePicker(\
                  initialDate: DateTime.now(),\
                  firstDate: DateTime(1900),\
                  lastDate: DateTime(2100),\
                  onDateChanged: (value) {},\
                );\
              },\
            ),\
          ),\
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

Hot reload the app and the `CalendarDatePicker`
widget should re-render in Spanish.


### Adding your own localized messages

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#adding-your-own-localized-messages)

After adding the `flutter_localizations` package,
you can configure localization.
To add localized text to your application,
complete the following instructions:


1. Add the `intl` package as a dependency, pulling
    in the version pinned by `flutter_localizations`:





```
$ flutter pub add intl:any
```

content\_copy

2. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and enable the `generate` flag.
    This flag is found in the `flutter` section in the pubspec file.



yaml

```
# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
     generate: true # Add this line
```

content\_copy

3. Add a new yaml file to the root directory of the Flutter project.
    Name this file `l10n.yaml` and include the following content:



yaml

```
arb-dir: lib/l10n
template-arb-file: app_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
```

content\_copy



This file configures the localization tool.
    In this example, you've done the following:
   - Put the [App Resource Bundle](https://github.com/google/app-resource-bundle) (`.arb`) input files in
      `${FLUTTER_PROJECT}/lib/l10n`.
      The `.arb` provide localization resources for your app.
   - Set the English template as `app_en.arb`.
   - Told Flutter to generate localizations in the
      `app_localizations.dart` file.
4. In `${FLUTTER_PROJECT}/lib/l10n`,
    add the `app_en.arb` template file. For example:



json

```
{
     "helloWorld": "Hello World!",
     "@helloWorld": {
       "description": "The conventional newborn programmer greeting"
     }
}
```

content\_copy

5. Add another bundle file called `app_es.arb` in the same directory.
    In this file, add the Spanish translation of the same message.



json

```
{
       "helloWorld": "¡Hola Mundo!"
}
```

content\_copy

6. Now, run `flutter pub get` or `flutter run` and codegen takes place automatically.
    You should find generated files in the directory at the path you specified
    with the `arb-dir` or `output-dir` options
    Alternatively, you can also run `flutter gen-l10n` to
    generate the same files without running the app.

7. Add the import statement on `app_localizations.dart` and
    `AppLocalizations.delegate`
    in your call to the constructor for `MaterialApp`:



dart

```
import 'l10n/app_localizations.dart';
```

content\_copy





dart

```
return const MaterialApp(
     title: 'Localizations Sample App',
     localizationsDelegates: [\
       AppLocalizations.delegate, // Add this line\
       GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,\
       GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,\
       GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,\
     ],
     supportedLocales: [\
       Locale('en'), // English\
       Locale('es'), // Spanish\
     ],
     home: MyHomePage(),
);
```

content\_copy



The `AppLocalizations` class also provides auto-generated
    `localizationsDelegates` and `supportedLocales` lists.
    You can use these instead of providing them manually.



dart

```
const MaterialApp(
     title: 'Localizations Sample App',
     localizationsDelegates: AppLocalizations.localizationsDelegates,
     supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
);
```

content\_copy

8. Once the Material app has started,
    you can use `AppLocalizations` anywhere in your app:



dart

```
appBar: AppBar(
     // The [AppBar] title text should update its message
     // according to the system locale of the target platform.
     // Switching between English and Spanish locales should
     // cause this text to update.
     title: Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.helloWorld),
),
```

content\_copy


This code generates a `Text` widget that displays "Hello World!"
if the target device's locale is set to English,
and "¡Hola Mundo!" if the target device's locale is set
to Spanish. In the `arb` files,
the key of each entry is used as the method name of the getter,
while the value of that entry contains the localized message.


The [`gen_l10n_example`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/internationalization/gen_l10n_example)
uses this tool.


To localize your device app description,
pass the localized string to
[`MaterialApp.onGenerateTitle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/onGenerateTitle.html):


dart

```
return MaterialApp(
  onGenerateTitle: (context) => DemoLocalizations.of(context).title,
```

content\_copy

### Placeholders, plurals, and selects

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#placeholders-plurals-and-selects)

You can also include application values in a message with
special syntax that uses a _placeholder_ to generate a method
instead of a getter.
A placeholder, which must be a valid Dart identifier name,
becomes a positional parameter in the generated method in the
`AppLocalizations` code. Define a placeholder name by wrapping
it in curly braces as follows:


json

```
"{placeholderName}"
```

content\_copy

Define each placeholder in the `placeholders` object
in the app's `.arb` file. For example,
to define a hello message with a `userName` parameter,
add the following to `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`:


json

```
"hello": "Hello {userName}",
"@hello": {
  "description": "A message with a single parameter",
  "placeholders": {
    "userName": {
      "type": "String",
      "example": "Bob"
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

This code snippet adds a `hello` method call to
the `AppLocalizations.of(context)` object,
and the method accepts a parameter of type `String`;
the `hello` method returns a string.
Regenerate the `AppLocalizations` file.


Replace the code passed into `Builder` with the following:

dart

```
// Examples of internationalized strings.
return Column(
  children: <Widget>[\
    // Returns 'Hello John'\
    Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.hello('John')),\
  ],
);
```

content\_copy

You can also use numerical placeholders to specify multiple values.
Different languages have different ways to pluralize words.
The syntax also supports specifying _how_ a word should be pluralized.
A _pluralized_ message must include a `num` parameter indicating
how to pluralize the word in different situations.
English, for example, pluralizes "person" to "people",
but that doesn't go far enough.
The `message0` plural might be "no people" or "zero people".
The `messageFew` plural might be
"several people", "some people", or "a few people".
The `messageMany` plural might
be "most people" or "many people", or "a crowd".
Only the more general `messageOther` field is required.
The following example shows what options are available:


json

```
"{countPlaceholder, plural, =0{message0} =1{message1} =2{message2} few{messageFew} many{messageMany} other{messageOther}}"
```

content\_copy

The previous expression is replaced by the message variation
(`message0`, `message1`, ...) corresponding to the value
of the `countPlaceholder`.
Only the `messageOther` field is required.


The following example defines a message that pluralizes
the word, "wombat":


json

```
"nWombats": "{count, plural, =0{no wombats} =1{1 wombat} other{{count} wombats}}",
"@nWombats": {
  "description": "A plural message",
  "placeholders": {
    "count": {
      "type": "num",
      "format": "compact"
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Use a plural method by passing in the `count` parameter:

dart

```
// Examples of internationalized strings.
return Column(
  children: <Widget>[\
    ...\
    // Returns 'no wombats'\
    Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.nWombats(0)),\
    // Returns '1 wombat'\
    Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.nWombats(1)),\
    // Returns '5 wombats'\
    Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.nWombats(5)),\
  ],
);
```

content\_copy

Similar to plurals,
you can also choose a value based on a `String` placeholder.
This is most often used to support gendered languages.
The syntax is as follows:


json

```
"{selectPlaceholder, select, case{message} ... other{messageOther}}"
```

content\_copy

The next example defines a message that
selects a pronoun based on gender:


json

```
"pronoun": "{gender, select, male{he} female{she} other{they}}",
"@pronoun": {
  "description": "A gendered message",
  "placeholders": {
    "gender": {
      "type": "String"
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Use this feature by
passing the gender string as a parameter:


dart

```
// Examples of internationalized strings.
return Column(
  children: <Widget>[\
    ...\
    // Returns 'he'\
    Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.pronoun('male')),\
    // Returns 'she'\
    Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.pronoun('female')),\
    // Returns 'they'\
    Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.pronoun('other')),\
  ],
);
```

content\_copy

Keep in mind that when using `select` statements,
comparison between the parameter and the actual
value is case-sensitive.
That is, `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.pronoun("Male")`
defaults to the "other" case, and returns "they".


### Escaping syntax

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#escaping-syntax)

Sometimes, you have to use tokens,
such as `{` and `}`, as normal characters.
To ignore such tokens from being parsed,
enable the `use-escaping` flag by adding the
following to `l10n.yaml`:


yaml

```
use-escaping: true
```

content\_copy

The parser ignores any string of characters
wrapped with a pair of single quotes.
To use a normal single quote character,
use a pair of consecutive single quotes.
For example, the following text is converted
to a Dart `String`:


json

```
{
  "helloWorld": "Hello! '{Isn''t}' this a wonderful day?"
}
```

content\_copy

The resulting string is as follows:

dart

```
"Hello! {Isn't} this a wonderful day?"
```

content\_copy

### Messages with numbers and currencies

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#messages-with-numbers-and-currencies)

Numbers, including those that represent currency values,
are displayed very differently in different locales.
The localizations generation tool in
`flutter_localizations` uses the
[`NumberFormat`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/intl/NumberFormat-class.html)

class in the `intl` package to format
numbers based on the locale and the desired format.


The `int`, `double`, and `num` types can use any of the
following `NumberFormat` constructors:


| Message "format" value | Output for 1200000 |
| --- | --- |
| `compact` | "1.2M" |
| `compactCurrency`\* | "$1.2M" |
| `compactSimpleCurrency`\* | "$1.2M" |
| `compactLong` | "1.2 million" |
| `currency`\* | "USD1,200,000.00" |
| `decimalPattern` | "1,200,000" |
| `decimalPatternDigits`\* | "1,200,000" |
| `decimalPercentPattern`\* | "120,000,000%" |
| `percentPattern` | "120,000,000%" |
| `scientificPattern` | "1E6" |
| `simpleCurrency`\* | "$1,200,000" |

The starred `NumberFormat` constructors in the table
offer optional, named parameters.
Those parameters can be specified as the value
of the placeholder's `optionalParameters` object.
For example, to specify the optional `decimalDigits`
parameter for `compactCurrency`,
make the following changes to the `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` file:


json

```
"numberOfDataPoints": "Number of data points: {value}",
"@numberOfDataPoints": {
  "description": "A message with a formatted int parameter",
  "placeholders": {
    "value": {
      "type": "int",
      "format": "compactCurrency",
      "optionalParameters": {
        "decimalDigits": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

### Messages with dates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#messages-with-dates)

Dates strings are formatted in many different ways
depending both the locale and the app's needs.


Placeholder values with type `DateTime` are formatted with
[`DateFormat`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/intl/DateFormat-class.html)
in the `intl` package.


There are 41 format variations,
identified by the names of their `DateFormat` factory constructors.
In the following example, the `DateTime` value
that appears in the `helloWorldOn` message is
formatted with `DateFormat.yMd`:


json

```
"helloWorldOn": "Hello World on {date}",
"@helloWorldOn": {
  "description": "A message with a date parameter",
  "placeholders": {
    "date": {
      "type": "DateTime",
      "format": "yMd"
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

In an app where the locale is US English,
the following expression would produce "7/9/1959".
In a Russian locale, it would produce "9.07.1959".


dart

```
AppLocalizations.of(context).helloWorldOn(DateTime.utc(1959, 7, 9))
```

content\_copy

### Localizing for iOS: Updating the iOS app bundle

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#localizing-for-ios-updating-the-ios-app-bundle)

Although the localizations are handled by Flutter,
you need to add the supported languages in the Xcode project.
This ensures your entry in the App Store correctly displays
the supported languages.


To configure the locales supported by your app,
use the following instructions:


1. Open your project's `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` Xcode file.

2. In the **Project Navigator**, select the `Runner` project
    file under **Projects**.

3. Select the `Info` tab in the project editor.

4. In the **Localizations** section, click the `Add` button
    (`+`) to add the supported languages and regions to your
    project. When asked to choose files and reference language,
    simply select `Finish`.

5. Xcode automatically creates empty `.strings` files and
    updates the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` file.
    These files are used by the App Store to determine which
    languages and regions your app supports.


## Advanced topics for further customization

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#advanced-topics-for-further-customization)

This section covers additional ways to customize a
localized Flutter application.


### Advanced locale definition

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#advanced-locale-definition)

Some languages with multiple variants require more than just a
language code to properly differentiate.


For example, fully differentiating all variants of
Chinese requires specifying the language code, script code,
and country code. This is due to the existence
of simplified and traditional script, as well as regional
differences in the way characters are written within the same script type.


In order to fully express every variant of Chinese for the
country codes `CN`, `TW`, and `HK`, the list of supported
locales should include:


dart

```
supportedLocales: [\
  Locale.fromSubtags(languageCode: 'zh'), // generic Chinese 'zh'\
  Locale.fromSubtags(\
    languageCode: 'zh',\
    scriptCode: 'Hans',\
  ), // generic simplified Chinese 'zh_Hans'\
  Locale.fromSubtags(\
    languageCode: 'zh',\
    scriptCode: 'Hant',\
  ), // generic traditional Chinese 'zh_Hant'\
  Locale.fromSubtags(\
    languageCode: 'zh',\
    scriptCode: 'Hans',\
    countryCode: 'CN',\
  ), // 'zh_Hans_CN'\
  Locale.fromSubtags(\
    languageCode: 'zh',\
    scriptCode: 'Hant',\
    countryCode: 'TW',\
  ), // 'zh_Hant_TW'\
  Locale.fromSubtags(\
    languageCode: 'zh',\
    scriptCode: 'Hant',\
    countryCode: 'HK',\
  ), // 'zh_Hant_HK'\
],
```

content\_copy

This explicit full definition ensures that your app can
distinguish between and provide the fully nuanced localized
content to all combinations of these country codes.
If a user's preferred locale isn't specified,
Flutter selects the closest match,
which likely contains differences to what the user expects.
Flutter only resolves to locales defined in `supportedLocales`
and provides scriptCode-differentiated localized
content for commonly used languages.
See [`Localizations`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsApp/supportedLocales.html)
for information on how the supported
locales and the preferred locales are resolved.


Although Chinese is a primary example,
other languages like French (`fr_FR`, `fr_CA`)
should also be fully differentiated for more nuanced localization.


### Tracking the locale: The Locale class and the Localizations widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#tracking-the-locale-the-locale-class-and-the-localizations-widget)

The [`Locale`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Locale-class.html) class identifies the user's language.
Mobile devices support setting the locale for all applications,
usually using a system settings menu.
Internationalized apps respond by displaying values that are
locale-specific. For example, if the user switches the device's locale
from English to French, then a `Text` widget that originally
displayed "Hello World" would be rebuilt with "Bonjour le monde".


The [`Localizations`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/GlobalWidgetsLocalizations-class.html)
widget defines the locale
for its child and the localized resources that the child depends on.
The [`WidgetsApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsApp-class.html)
widget creates a `Localizations` widget
and rebuilds it if the system's locale changes.


You can always look up an app's current locale with
`Localizations.localeOf()`:


dart

```
Locale myLocale = Localizations.localeOf(context);
```

content\_copy

### Specifying the app's supported­Locales parameter

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#specifying-the-apps-supportedshylocales-parameter)

Although the `flutter_localizations` library
supports many languages and language variants,
only English language translations are available by default.
It's up to the developer to decide exactly which languages to support.


The `MaterialApp` [`supportedLocales`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/supportedLocales.html)

parameter limits locale changes. When the user changes the locale
setting on their device, the app's `Localizations` widget only
follows suit if the new locale is a member of this list.
If an exact match for the device locale isn't found,
then the first supported locale with a matching [`languageCode`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Locale/languageCode.html)

is used. If that fails, then the first element of the
`supportedLocales` list is used.


An app that wants to use a different "locale resolution"
method can provide a [`localeResolutionCallback`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LocaleResolutionCallback.html).
For example, to have your app unconditionally accept
whatever locale the user selects:


dart

```
MaterialApp(
  localeResolutionCallback: (locale, supportedLocales) {
    return locale;
  },
);
```

content\_copy

### Configuring the l10n.yaml file

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#configuring-the-l10n-yaml-file)

The `l10n.yaml` file allows you to configure the `gen-l10n` tool
to specify the following:


- where all the input files are located
- where all the output files should be created
- what Dart class name to give your localizations delegate

For a full list of options, either run `flutter gen-l10n --help`
at the command line or refer to the following table:


| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `arb-dir` | The directory where the template and translated arb files are located. The default is <br> `lib/l10n`<br> . |
| `output-dir` | The directory where the generated localization classes are written. This option is only relevant if you want to generate the localizations code somewhere else in the Flutter project. You also need to set the <br> `synthetic-package`<br> flag to false.<br> <br> The app must import the file specified in the <br> `output-localization-file`<br> option from this directory. If unspecified, this defaults to the same directory as the input directory specified in <br> `arb-dir`<br> . |
| `template-arb-file` | The template arb file that is used as the basis for generating the Dart localization and messages files. The default is <br> `app_en.arb`<br> . |
| `output-localization-file` | The filename for the output localization and localizations delegate classes. The default is <br> `app_localizations.dart`<br> . |
| `untranslated-messages-file` | The location of a file that describes the localization messages haven't been translated yet. Using this option creates a JSON file at the target location, in the following format: <br> <br>`"locale": ["message_1", "message_2" ... "message_n"]`<br> If this option is not specified, a summary of the messages that haven't been translated are printed on the command line. |
| `output-class` | The Dart class name to use for the output localization and localizations delegate classes. The default is <br> `AppLocalizations`<br> . |
| `preferred-supported-locales` | The list of preferred supported locales for the application. By default, the tool generates the supported locales list in alphabetical order. Use this flag to default to a different locale.<br> <br> For example, pass in <br> `[ en_US ]`<br> to default to American English if a device supports it. |
| `header` | The header to prepend to the generated Dart localizations files. This option takes in a string.<br> <br> For example, pass in <br> `"/// All localized files."`<br> to prepend this string to the generated Dart file.<br> <br> Alternatively, check out the <br> `header-file`<br> option to pass in a text file for longer headers. |
| `header-file` | The header to prepend to the generated Dart localizations files. The value of this option is the name of the file that contains the header text that is inserted at the top of each generated Dart file. <br> <br> Alternatively, check out the <br> `header`<br> option to pass in a string for a simpler header.<br> <br> This file should be placed in the directory specified in <br> `arb-dir`<br> . |
| `[no-]use-deferred-loading` | Specifies whether to generate the Dart localization file with locales imported as deferred, allowing for lazy loading of each locale in Flutter web.<br> <br> This can reduce a web app's initial startup time by decreasing the size of the JavaScript bundle. When this flag is set to true, the messages for a particular locale are only downloaded and loaded by the Flutter app as they are needed. For projects with a lot of different locales and many localization strings, it can improve performance to defer loading. For projects with a small number of locales, the difference is negligible, and might slow down the start up compared to bundling the localizations with the rest of the application.<br> <br> Note that this flag doesn't affect other platforms such as mobile or desktop. |
| `gen-inputs-and-outputs-list` | When specified, the tool generates a JSON file containing the tool's inputs and outputs, named <br> `gen_l10n_inputs_and_outputs.json`<br> .<br> <br> This can be useful for keeping track of which files of the Flutter project were used when generating the latest set of localizations. For example, the Flutter tool's build system uses this file to keep track of when to call gen\_l10n during hot reload.<br> <br> The value of this option is the directory where the JSON file is generated. When null, the JSON file won't be generated. |
| `synthetic-package` | Determines whether the generated output files are generated as a synthetic package or at a specified directory in the Flutter project. This flag is <br> `true`<br> by default. When <br> `synthetic-package`<br> is set to <br> `false`<br> , it generates the localizations files in the directory specified by <br> `arb-dir`<br> by default. If <br> `output-dir`<br> is specified, files are generated there. |
| `project-dir` | When specified, the tool uses the path passed into this option as the directory of the root Flutter project.<br> <br> When null, the relative path to the present working directory is used. |
| `[no-]required-resource-attributes` | Requires all resource ids to contain a corresponding resource attribute.<br> <br> By default, simple messages won't require metadata, but it's highly recommended as this provides context for the meaning of a message to readers.<br> <br> Resource attributes are still required for plural messages. |
| `[no-]nullable-getter` | Specifies whether the localizations class getter is nullable.<br> <br> By default, this value is true so that <br> `Localizations.of(context)`<br> returns a nullable value for backwards compatibility. If this value is false, then a null check is performed on the returned value of <br> `Localizations.of(context)`<br> , removing the need for null checking in user code. |
| `[no-]format` | When specified, the `dart format` command is run after generating the localization files. |
| `use-escaping` | Specifies whether to enable the use of single quotes as escaping syntax. |
| `[no-]suppress-warnings` | When specified, all warnings are suppressed. |
| `[no-]relax-syntax` | When specified, the syntax is relaxed so that the special character "{" is treated as a string if not followed by a valid placeholder and "}" is treated as a string if it doesn't close any previous "{" that is treated as a special character. |
| `[no-]use-named-parameters` | Whether to use named parameters for the generated localization methods. |

## How internationalization in Flutter works

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#how-internationalization-in-flutter-works)

This section covers the technical details of how localizations work
in Flutter. If you're planning on supporting your own set of localized
messages, the following content would be helpful.
Otherwise, you can skip this section.


### Loading and retrieving localized values

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#loading-and-retrieving-localized-values)

The `Localizations` widget is used to load and
look up objects that contain collections of localized values.
Apps refer to these objects with [`Localizations.of(context,type)`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Localizations/of.html).
If the device's locale changes,
the `Localizations` widget automatically loads values for
the new locale and then rebuilds widgets that used it.
This happens because `Localizations` works like an
[`InheritedWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html).
When a build function refers to an inherited widget,
an implicit dependency on the inherited widget is created.
When an inherited widget changes
(when the `Localizations` widget's locale changes),
its dependent contexts are rebuilt.


Localized values are loaded by the `Localizations` widget's
list of [`LocalizationsDelegate`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LocalizationsDelegate-class.html) s.
Each delegate must define an asynchronous [`load()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LocalizationsDelegate/load.html)

method that produces an object that encapsulates a
collection of localized values.
Typically these objects define one method per localized value.


In a large app, different modules or packages might be bundled with
their own localizations. That's why the `Localizations` widget
manages a table of objects, one per `LocalizationsDelegate`.
To retrieve the object produced by one of the `LocalizationsDelegate`'s
`load` methods, specify a `BuildContext` and the object's type.


For example,
the localized strings for the Material Components widgets
are defined by the [`MaterialLocalizations`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialLocalizations-class.html)
class.
Instances of this class are created by a `LocalizationDelegate`
provided by the [`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)
class.
They can be retrieved with `Localizations.of()`:


dart

```
Localizations.of<MaterialLocalizations>(context, MaterialLocalizations);
```

content\_copy

This particular `Localizations.of()` expression is used frequently,
so the `MaterialLocalizations` class provides a convenient shorthand:


dart

```
static MaterialLocalizations of(BuildContext context) {
  return Localizations.of<MaterialLocalizations>(context, MaterialLocalizations);
}
​
/// References to the localized values defined by MaterialLocalizations
/// are typically written like this:
​
tooltip: MaterialLocalizations.of(context).backButtonTooltip,
```

content\_copy

### Defining a class for the app's localized resources

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#defining-a-class-for-the-apps-localized-resources)

Putting together an internationalized Flutter app usually
starts with the class that encapsulates the app's localized values.
The example that follows is typical of such classes.


Complete source code for the [`intl_example`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/internationalization/intl_example)
for this app.


This example is based on the APIs and tools provided by the
[`intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package. The [An alternative class for the app's\\
localized resources](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#alternative-class) section
describes [an example](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/internationalization/minimal)
that doesn't depend on the `intl` package.


The `DemoLocalizations` class
(defined in the following code snippet)
contains the app's strings (just one for the example)
translated into the locales that the app supports.
It uses the `initializeMessages()` function
generated by Dart's [`intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package,
[`Intl.message()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/intl/latest/intl/Intl/message.html), to look them up.


dart

```
class DemoLocalizations {
  DemoLocalizations(this.localeName);
​
  static Future<DemoLocalizations> load(Locale locale) {
    final String name =
        locale.countryCode == null || locale.countryCode!.isEmpty
        ? locale.languageCode
        : locale.toString();
    final String localeName = Intl.canonicalizedLocale(name);
​
    return initializeMessages(localeName).then((_) {
      return DemoLocalizations(localeName);
    });
  }
​
  static DemoLocalizations of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of<DemoLocalizations>(context, DemoLocalizations)!;
  }
​
  final String localeName;
​
  String get title {
    return Intl.message(
      'Hello World',
      name: 'title',
      desc: 'Title for the Demo application',
      locale: localeName,
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

A class based on the `intl` package imports a generated
message catalog that provides the `initializeMessages()`
function and the per-locale backing store for `Intl.message()`.
The message catalog is produced by an [`intl` tool](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#dart-tools)

that analyzes the source code for classes that contain
`Intl.message()` calls.
In this case that would just be the `DemoLocalizations` class.


### Adding support for a new language

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#adding-support-for-a-new-language)

An app that needs to support a language that's not included in
[`GlobalMaterialLocalizations`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/GlobalMaterialLocalizations-class.html)
has to do some extra work:
it must provide about 70 translations ("localizations")
for words or phrases and the date patterns and symbols for the
locale.


See the following for an example of how to add
support for the Norwegian Nynorsk language.


A new `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` subclass defines the
localizations that the Material library depends on.
A new `LocalizationsDelegate` subclass, which serves
as factory for the `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` subclass,
must also be defined.


Here's the source code for the complete [`add_language`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/internationalization/add_language/lib/main.dart)
example,
minus the actual Nynorsk translations.


The locale-specific `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` subclass
is called `NnMaterialLocalizations`,
and the `LocalizationsDelegate` subclass is
`_NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate`.
The value of `NnMaterialLocalizations.delegate`
is an instance of the delegate, and is all
that's needed by an app that uses these localizations.


The delegate class includes basic date and number format
localizations. All of the other localizations are defined by `String`
valued property getters in `NnMaterialLocalizations`, like this:


dart

```
@override
String get moreButtonTooltip => r'More';
​
@override
String get aboutListTileTitleRaw => r'About $applicationName';
​
@override
String get alertDialogLabel => r'Alert';
```

content\_copy

These are the English translations, of course.
To complete the job you need to change the return
value of each getter to an appropriate Nynorsk string.


The getters return "raw" Dart strings that have an `r` prefix,
such as `r'About $applicationName'`,
because sometimes the strings contain variables with a `$` prefix.
The variables are expanded by parameterized localization methods:


dart

```
@override
String get pageRowsInfoTitleRaw => r'$firstRow–$lastRow of $rowCount';
​
@override
String get pageRowsInfoTitleApproximateRaw =>
    r'$firstRow–$lastRow of about $rowCount';
```

content\_copy

The date patterns and symbols of the locale also need to
be specified, which are defined in the source code as follows:


dart

```
const nnLocaleDatePatterns = {
  'd': 'd.',
  'E': 'ccc',
  'EEEE': 'cccc',
  'LLL': 'LLL',
  // ...
}
```

content\_copy

dart

```
const nnDateSymbols = {
  'NAME': 'nn',
  'ERAS': <dynamic>['f.Kr.', 'e.Kr.'],
```

content\_copy

These values need to be modified for the locale to use the correct
date formatting. Unfortunately, since the `intl` library doesn't
share the same flexibility for number formatting,
the formatting for an existing locale must be used
as a substitute in `_NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate`:


dart

```
class _NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate
    extends LocalizationsDelegate<MaterialLocalizations> {
  const _NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate();
​
  @override
  bool isSupported(Locale locale) => locale.languageCode == 'nn';
​
  @override
  Future<MaterialLocalizations> load(Locale locale) async {
    final String localeName = intl.Intl.canonicalizedLocale(locale.toString());
​
    // The locale (in this case `nn`) needs to be initialized into the custom
    // date symbols and patterns setup that Flutter uses.
    date_symbol_data_custom.initializeDateFormattingCustom(
      locale: localeName,
      patterns: nnLocaleDatePatterns,
      symbols: intl.DateSymbols.deserializeFromMap(nnDateSymbols),
    );

For more information about localization strings,
check out the [flutter\_localizations README](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/packages/flutter_localizations/lib/src/l10n/README.md).


Once you've implemented your language-specific subclasses of
`GlobalMaterialLocalizations` and `LocalizationsDelegate`,
you need to add the language and a delegate instance to your app.
The following code sets the app's language to Nynorsk and
adds the `NnMaterialLocalizations` delegate instance to the app's
`localizationsDelegates` list:


dart

```
const MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: [\
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,\
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,\
    NnMaterialLocalizations.delegate, // Add the newly created delegate\
  ],
  supportedLocales: [Locale('en', 'US'), Locale('nn')],
  home: Home(),
),
```

## Alternative internationalization workflows

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#alternative-internationalization-workflows)

This section describes different approaches to internationalize
your Flutter application.


### An alternative class for the app's localized resources

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#an-alternative-class-for-the-apps-localized-resources)

The previous example was defined in terms of the Dart `intl`
package. You can choose your own approach for managing
localized values for the sake of simplicity or perhaps to integrate
with a different i18n framework.


Complete source code for the [`minimal`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/internationalization/minimal)
app.


In the following example, the `DemoLocalizations` class
includes all of its translations directly in per language Maps:


dart

```
class DemoLocalizations {
  DemoLocalizations(this.locale);
​
  final Locale locale;
​
  static DemoLocalizations of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of<DemoLocalizations>(context, DemoLocalizations)!;
  }
​
  static const _localizedValues = <String, Map<String, String>>{
    'en': {'title': 'Hello World'},
    'es': {'title': 'Hola Mundo'},
  };
​
  static List<String> languages() => _localizedValues.keys.toList();
​
  String get title {
    return _localizedValues[locale.languageCode]!['title']!;
  }
}
```

content\_copy

In the minimal app the `DemoLocalizationsDelegate` is slightly
different. Its `load` method returns a [`SynchronousFuture`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/SynchronousFuture-class.html)

because no asynchronous loading needs to take place.


dart

```
class DemoLocalizationsDelegate
    extends LocalizationsDelegate<DemoLocalizations> {
  const DemoLocalizationsDelegate();
​
  @override
  bool isSupported(Locale locale) =>
      DemoLocalizations.languages().contains(locale.languageCode);
​
  @override
  Future<DemoLocalizations> load(Locale locale) {
    // Returning a SynchronousFuture here because an async "load" operation
    // isn't needed to produce an instance of DemoLocalizations.
    return SynchronousFuture<DemoLocalizations>(DemoLocalizations(locale));
  }
​
  @override
  bool shouldReload(DemoLocalizationsDelegate old) => false;
}
```

### Using the Dart intl tools

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization#using-the-dart-intl-tools)

Before building an API using the Dart [`intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package,
review the `intl` package's documentation.
The following list summarizes the process for
localizing an app that depends on the `intl` package:


The demo app depends on a generated source file called
`l10n/messages_all.dart`, which defines all of the
localizable strings used by the app.


Rebuilding `l10n/messages_all.dart` requires two steps.

1. With the app's root directory as the current directory,
    generate `l10n/intl_messages.arb` from `lib/main.dart`:





```
$ dart run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/main.dart
```

content\_copy



The `intl_messages.arb` file is a JSON format map with one entry for
    each `Intl.message()` function defined in `main.dart`.
    This file serves as a template for the English and Spanish translations,
    `intl_en.arb` and `intl_es.arb`.
    These translations are created by you, the developer.

2. With the app's root directory as the current directory,
    generate `intl_messages_<locale>.dart` for each
    `intl_<locale>.arb` file and `intl_messages_all.dart`,
    which imports all of the messages files:





```
$ dart run intl_translation:generate_from_arb \
       --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading \
       lib/main.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb
```

content\_copy



_**Windows doesn't support file name wildcarding.**_
    Instead, list the .arb files that were generated by the
    `intl_translation:extract_to_arb` command.





```
$ dart run intl_translation:generate_from_arb \
       --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading \
       lib/main.dart \
       lib/l10n/intl_en.arb lib/l10n/intl_fr.arb lib/l10n/intl_messages.arb
```

content\_copy



The `DemoLocalizations` class uses the generated
    `initializeMessages()` function
    (defined in `intl_messages_all.dart`)
    to load the localized messages and `Intl.message()`
    to look them up.

[vertical\_align\_topUpgrade Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

No matter which one of the Flutter release channels
you follow, you can use the `flutter` command to upgrade your
Flutter SDK or the packages that your app depends on.


## Upgrade the Flutter SDK

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#upgrade-the-flutter-sdk)

To update the Flutter SDK use the `flutter upgrade` command:

```
$ flutter upgrade
```

content\_copy

This command gets the most recent version of the Flutter SDK
that's available on your current Flutter channel.


If you are using the **stable** channel
and want an even more recent version of the Flutter SDK,
switch to the **beta** channel using `flutter channel beta`,
and then run `flutter upgrade`.


### Keep informed

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#keep-informed)

We publish [migration guides](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes) for known breaking changes.

We send announcements regarding these changes to the
[Flutter announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce).


To avoid being broken by future versions of Flutter,
consider submitting your tests to our [test registry](https://github.com/flutter/tests).


## Switching Flutter channels

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#switching-flutter-channels)

Flutter has two release channels:
**stable** and **beta**.


### The **stable** channel

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#the-stable-channel)

We recommend the **stable** channel for new users
and for production app releases.
The team updates this channel about every three months.
The channel might receive occasional hot fixes
for high-severity or high-impact issues.


The continuous integration for the Flutter team's plugins and packages
includes testing against the latest **stable** release.


The latest documentation for the **stable** branch
is at: [https://api.flutter.dev](https://api.flutter.dev/)

### The **beta** channel

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#the-beta-channel)

The **beta** channel has the latest stable release.
This is the most recent version of Flutter that we have heavily tested.
This channel has passed all our public testing,
has been verified against test suites for Google products that use Flutter,
and has been vetted against [contributed private test suites](https://github.com/flutter/tests).
The **beta** channel receives regular hot fixes
to address newly discovered important issues.


The **beta** channel is essentially the same as the **stable** channel
but updated monthly instead of quarterly.
Indeed, when the **stable** channel is updated,
it is updated to the latest **beta** release.


### Other channels

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#other-channels)

We currently have one other channel, **main** (previously known as **master**).
People who [contribute to Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
use this channel.


This channel is not as thoroughly tested as
the **beta** and **stable** channels.


We do not recommend using this channel as
it is more likely to contain serious regressions.


The latest documentation for the **main** branch
is at: [https://main-api.flutter.dev](https://main-api.flutter.dev/)

### Change channels

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#change-channels)

To view your current channel, use the following command:

```
$ flutter channel
```

content\_copy

To change to another channel, use `flutter channel <channel-name>`.
Once you've changed your channel, use `flutter upgrade`
to download the latest Flutter SDK and dependent packages for that channel.
For example:


```
$ flutter channel beta
$ flutter upgrade
```

content\_copy

## Switch to a specific Flutter version

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#switch-to-a-specific-flutter-version)

To switch to a specific Flutter version:

1. Find your desired **Flutter version** on the [Flutter SDK archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/archive).

2. Navigate to the Flutter SDK:





```
$ cd /path/to/flutter
```

content\_copy

3. Use `git checkout` to switch to your desired **Flutter version**:





```
$ git checkout <Flutter version>
```

content\_copy


## Upgrade packages

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#upgrade-packages)

If you've modified your `pubspec.yaml` file, or you want to update
only the packages that your app depends upon
(instead of both the packages and Flutter itself),
then use one of the `flutter pub` commands.


To update to the _latest compatible versions_ of
all the dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file,
use the `upgrade` command:


```
$ flutter pub upgrade
```

content\_copy

To update to the _latest possible version_ of
all the dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file,
use the `upgrade --major-versions` command:


```
$ flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
```

content\_copy

This also automatically update the constraints
in the `pubspec.yaml` file.


To identify out-of-date package dependencies and get advice
on how to update them, use the `outdated` command. For details, see
the Dart [`pub outdated` documentation](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-outdated).


```
$ flutter pub outdated
```

content\_copy

## Troubleshooting

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#troubleshooting)

### Windows: "Filename too long" error

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade#windows-filename-too-long-error)

When running `flutter upgrade` on Windows,
you might encounter an error like the following:


```
error: unable to create file ...: Filename too long
```

content\_copy

This occurs because the path to a file in the Flutter SDK exceeds the default
maximum path length limit on Windows.


To resolve this issue, consider installing the Flutter SDK
at a shorter path. For example, install Flutter at
`C:\Flutter` instead of something longer like
`C:\Users\<user name>\Documents\flutter`.


Otherwise, do the following:

1. Enable long paths support in Git:





```
$ git config --system core.longpaths true
```

content\_copy



If the command fails with a permission error,
    try running your terminal as an administrator.

2. Enable long paths in Windows:





```
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

content\_copy



This command requires administrator privileges.

From a user experience (UX) perspective,
the most important thing is to show your users
that loading is taking place. One popular approach
to communicate to users that data is loading is to
display a chrome color with a shimmer animation over
the shapes that approximate the type of content that is loading.


The following animation shows the app's behavior:

![Gif showing the UI loading](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/cookbook/effects/UILoadingAnimation.webp)

This recipe begins with the content widgets defined and positioned.
There is also a Floating Action Button (FAB) in the bottom-right
corner that toggles between a loading mode and a loaded mode
so that you can easily validate your implementation.


## Draw the shimmer shapes

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/shimmer-loading#draw-the-shimmer-shapes)

The shapes that shimmer in this effect are independent
from the actual content that eventually loads.


Therefore, the goal is to display shapes that represent
the eventual content as accurately as possible.


Displaying accurate shapes is easy in situations where the
content has a clear boundary. For example, in this recipe,
there are some circular images and some rounded rectangle images.
You can draw shapes that precisely match the outlines
of those images.


On the other hand, consider the text that appears beneath the
rounded rectangle images. You won't know how many lines of
text exist until the text loads.
Therefore, there is no point in trying to draw a rectangle
for every line of text. Instead, while the data is loading,
you draw a couple of very thin rounded rectangles that
represent the text that will appear. The shape and size
doesn't quite match, but that is OK.


Start with the circular list items at the top of the screen.
Ensure that each `CircleListItem` widget displays a circle
with a color while the image is loading.


dart

```
class CircleListItem extends StatelessWidget {
  const CircleListItem({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8, vertical: 8),
      child: Container(
        width: 54,
        height: 54,
        decoration: const BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.black,
          shape: BoxShape.circle,
        ),
        child: ClipOval(
          child: Image.network(
            'https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/'
            'exercise/split-check/Avatar1.jpg',
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

As long as your widgets display some kind of shape,
you can apply the shimmer effect in this recipe.


Similar to the `CircleListItem` widgets,
ensure that the `CardListItem` widgets
display a color where the image will appear.
Also, in the `CardListItem` widget,
switch between the display of the text and
the rectangles based on the current loading status.


dart

```
class CardListItem extends StatelessWidget {
  const CardListItem({super.key, required this.isLoading});
​
  final bool isLoading;
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 24, vertical: 16),
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [_buildImage(), const SizedBox(height: 16), _buildText()],
      ),
    );
  }
​
  Widget _buildImage() {
    return AspectRatio(
      aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
      child: Container(
        width: double.infinity,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.black,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),
        ),
        child: ClipRRect(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),
          child: Image.network(
            'https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/'
            'exercise/split-check/Food1.jpg',
            fit: BoxFit.cover,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
​
  Widget _buildText() {
    if (isLoading) {
      return Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [\
          Container(\
            width: double.infinity,\
            height: 24,\
            decoration: BoxDecoration(\
              color: Colors.black,\
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),\
            ),\
          ),\
          const SizedBox(height: 16),\
          Container(\
            width: 250,\
            height: 24,\
            decoration: BoxDecoration(\
              color: Colors.black,\
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),\
            ),\
          ),\
        ],
      );
    } else {
      return const Padding(
        padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8),
        child: Text(
          'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do '
          'eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.',
        ),
      );
    }
  }
}
```

Your UI now renders itself differently depending on
whether it's loading or loaded.
By temporarily commenting out the image URLs,
you can see the two ways your UI renders.


![Gif showing the shimmer animation](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/cookbook/effects/LoadingShimmer.webp)

The next goal is to paint all of the colored areas
with a single gradient that looks like a shimmer.


## Paint the shimmer gradient

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/shimmer-loading#paint-the-shimmer-gradient)

The key to the effect achieved in this recipe is to use a widget
called [`ShaderMask`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ShaderMask-class.html). The
`ShaderMask` widget, as the name suggests,
applies a shader to its child, but only in the areas where
the child already painted something. For example,
you'll apply a shader to only the black shapes that you
configured earlier.


Define a chrome-colored, linear gradient that gets applied to the
shimmer shapes.


dart

```
const _shimmerGradient = LinearGradient(
  colors: [Color(0xFFEBEBF4), Color(0xFFF4F4F4), Color(0xFFEBEBF4)],
  stops: [0.1, 0.3, 0.4],
  begin: Alignment(-1.0, -0.3),
  end: Alignment(1.0, 0.3),
  tileMode: TileMode.clamp,
);
```

content\_copy

Define a new stateful widget called `ShimmerLoading`
that wraps a given `child` widget with a `ShaderMask`.
Configure the `ShaderMask` widget to apply the shimmer
gradient as a shader with a `blendMode` of `srcATop`.
The `srcATop` blend mode replaces any color that your
`child` widget painted with the shader color.


dart

```
class ShimmerLoading extends StatefulWidget {
  const ShimmerLoading({
    super.key,
    required this.isLoading,
    required this.child,
  });
​
  final bool isLoading;
  final Widget child;
​
  @override
  State<ShimmerLoading> createState() => _ShimmerLoadingState();
}
​
class _ShimmerLoadingState extends State<ShimmerLoading> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (!widget.isLoading) {
      return widget.child;
    }
​
    return ShaderMask(
      blendMode: BlendMode.srcATop,
      shaderCallback: (bounds) {
        return _shimmerGradient.createShader(bounds);
      },
      child: widget.child,
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Wrap your `CircleListItem` widgets with a `ShimmerLoading` widget.

dart

```
Widget _buildTopRowItem() {
  return ShimmerLoading(isLoading: _isLoading, child: const CircleListItem());
}
```

content\_copy

Wrap your `CardListItem` widgets with a `ShimmerLoading` widget.

dart

```
Widget _buildListItem() {
  return ShimmerLoading(
    isLoading: _isLoading,
    child: CardListItem(isLoading: _isLoading),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

When your shapes are loading, they now display
the shimmer gradient that is
returned from the `shaderCallback`.


This is a big step in the right direction,
but there's a problem with this gradient display.
Each `CircleListItem` widget and each `CardListItem` widget
displays a new version of the gradient.
For this recipe, the entire screen should
look like one, big shimmering surface.
You solve this problem in the next step.


## Paint one big shimmer

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/shimmer-loading#paint-one-big-shimmer)

To paint one big shimmer across the screen,
each `ShimmerLoading` widget needs
to paint the same full-screen gradient based
on the position of that `ShimmerLoading`
widget on the screen.


To be more precise, rather than assume that the shimmer
should take up the entire screen,
there should be some area that shares the shimmer.
Maybe that area takes up the entire screen,
or maybe it doesn't. The way to solve this
kind of problem in Flutter is to define another widget
that sits above all of the `ShimmerLoading` widgets
in the widget tree, and call it `Shimmer`.
Then, each `ShimmerLoading` widget gets a reference
to the `Shimmer` ancestor
and requests the desired size and gradient to display.


Define a new stateful widget called `Shimmer` that
takes in a [`LinearGradient`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/LinearGradient-class.html)
and provides descendants
with access to its `State` object.


dart

```
class Shimmer extends StatefulWidget {
  static ShimmerState? of(BuildContext context) {
    return context.findAncestorStateOfType<ShimmerState>();
  }
​
  const Shimmer({super.key, required this.linearGradient, this.child});
​
  final LinearGradient linearGradient;
  final Widget? child;
​
  @override
  ShimmerState createState() => ShimmerState();
}
​
class ShimmerState extends State<Shimmer> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return widget.child ?? const SizedBox();
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Add methods to the `ShimmerState` class in order
to provide access to the `linearGradient`,
the size of the `ShimmerState`'s `RenderBox`,
and look up the position of a descendant within the
`ShimmerState`'s `RenderBox`.


dart

```
class ShimmerState extends State<Shimmer> {
  Gradient get gradient => LinearGradient(
    colors: widget.linearGradient.colors,
    stops: widget.linearGradient.stops,
    begin: widget.linearGradient.begin,
    end: widget.linearGradient.end,
  );
​
  bool get isSized =>
      (context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox?)?.hasSize ?? false;
​
  Size get size => (context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox).size;
​
  Offset getDescendantOffset({
    required RenderBox descendant,
    Offset offset = Offset.zero,
  }) {
    final shimmerBox = context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox;
    return descendant.localToGlobal(offset, ancestor: shimmerBox);
  }
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return widget.child ?? const SizedBox();
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Wrap all of your screen's content with the `Shimmer` widget.

dart

```
class _ExampleUiLoadingAnimationState extends State<ExampleUiLoadingAnimation> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Shimmer(
        linearGradient: _shimmerGradient,
        child: ListView(
          // ListView Contents
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Use the `Shimmer` widget within your
`ShimmerLoading` widget to paint the shared gradient.


dart

```
class _ShimmerLoadingState extends State<ShimmerLoading> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (!widget.isLoading) {
      return widget.child;
    }
​
    // Collect ancestor shimmer information.
    final shimmer = Shimmer.of(context)!;
    if (!shimmer.isSized) {
      // The ancestor Shimmer widget isn't laid
      // out yet. Return an empty box.
      return const SizedBox();
    }
    final shimmerSize = shimmer.size;
    final gradient = shimmer.gradient;
    final offsetWithinShimmer = shimmer.getDescendantOffset(
      descendant: context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox,
    );
​
    return ShaderMask(
      blendMode: BlendMode.srcATop,
      shaderCallback: (bounds) {
        return gradient.createShader(
          Rect.fromLTWH(
            -offsetWithinShimmer.dx,
            -offsetWithinShimmer.dy,
            shimmerSize.width,
            shimmerSize.height,
          ),
        );
      },
      child: widget.child,
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Your `ShimmerLoading` widgets now display a shared
gradient that takes up all of the space within the
`Shimmer` widget.


## Animate the shimmer

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/shimmer-loading#animate-the-shimmer)

The shimmer gradient needs to move in order to
give the appearance of a shimmering shine.


The `LinearGradient` has a property called `transform`
that can be used to transform the appearance of the gradient,
for example, to move it horizontally.
The `transform` property accepts a `GradientTransform` instance.


Define a class called `_SlidingGradientTransform` that implements
`GradientTransform` to achieve the appearance of horizontal sliding.


dart

```
class _SlidingGradientTransform extends GradientTransform {
  const _SlidingGradientTransform({required this.slidePercent});
​
  final double slidePercent;
​
  @override
  Matrix4? transform(Rect bounds, {TextDirection? textDirection}) {
    return Matrix4.translationValues(bounds.width * slidePercent, 0.0, 0.0);
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The gradient slide percentage changes over time
in order to create the appearance of motion.
To change the percentage, configure an
[`AnimationController`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html)
in the `ShimmerState` class.


dart

```
class ShimmerState extends State<Shimmer> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _shimmerController;
​
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
​
    _shimmerController = AnimationController.unbounded(vsync: this)
      ..repeat(min: -0.5, max: 1.5, period: const Duration(milliseconds: 1000));
  }
​
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _shimmerController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
  }
```

content\_copy

Apply the `_SlidingGradientTransform` to the `gradient`
by using the `_shimmerController`'s `value` as the `slidePercent`.


dart

```
LinearGradient get gradient => LinearGradient(
  colors: widget.linearGradient.colors,
  stops: widget.linearGradient.stops,
  begin: widget.linearGradient.begin,
  end: widget.linearGradient.end,
  transform: _SlidingGradientTransform(
    slidePercent: _shimmerController.value,
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

The gradient now animates, but your individual
`ShimmerLoading` widgets don't repaint themselves
as the gradient changes. Therefore, it looks like nothing
is happening.


Expose the `_shimmerController` from `ShimmerState`
as a [`Listenable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html).


dart

```
Listenable get shimmerChanges => _shimmerController;
```

content\_copy

In `ShimmerLoading`, listen for changes to the ancestor
`ShimmerState`'s `shimmerChanges` property,
and repaint the shimmer gradient.


dart

```
class _ShimmerLoadingState extends State<ShimmerLoading> {
  Listenable? _shimmerChanges;
​
  @override
  void didChangeDependencies() {
    super.didChangeDependencies();
    if (_shimmerChanges != null) {
      _shimmerChanges!.removeListener(_onShimmerChange);
    }
    _shimmerChanges = Shimmer.of(context)?.shimmerChanges;
    if (_shimmerChanges != null) {
      _shimmerChanges!.addListener(_onShimmerChange);
    }
  }
​
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _shimmerChanges?.removeListener(_onShimmerChange);
    super.dispose();
  }
​
  void _onShimmerChange() {
    if (widget.isLoading) {
      setState(() {
        // Update the shimmer painting.
      });
    }
  }
  }
```

content\_copy

Congratulations!
You now have a full-screen,
animated shimmer effect that turns
on and off as the content loads.

Have you ever wanted to execute Dart code in the
background—even if your app wasn't the currently active app?
Perhaps you wanted to implement a process that watches the time,
or that catches camera movement.
In Flutter, you can execute Dart code in the background.


The mechanism for this feature involves setting up an isolate.
_Isolates_ are Dart's model for multithreading,
though an isolate differs from a conventional thread
in that it doesn't share memory with the main program.
You'll set up your isolate for background execution using
callbacks and a callback dispatcher.


Additionally, the [WorkManager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager) plugin enables persistent background processing
that keeps tasks scheduled through app restarts and system reboots.


For more information and a geofencing example that uses background
execution of Dart code, see the Medium article by Ben Konyi,
[Executing Dart in the Background with Flutter Plugins and\\
Geofencing](https://blog.flutter.dev/executing-dart-in-the-background-with-flutter-plugins-and-geofencing-2b3e40a1a124). At the end of this article,
you'll find links to example code, and relevant documentation for Dart,
iOS, and Android.

It isn't enough to just adapt how your app looks,
you also have to support a variety of user inputs.
The mouse and keyboard introduce input types beyond those
found on a touch device, like scroll wheel, right-click,
hover interactions, tab traversal, and keyboard shortcuts.


Some of these features work by default on Material
widgets. But, if you've created a custom widget,
you might need to implement them directly.


Some features that encompass a well-designed app,
also help users who work with assistive technologies.
For example, aside from being **good app design**,
some features, like tab traversal and keyboard shortcuts,
are _critical for users who work with assistive devices_.
In addition to the standard advice for
[creating accessible apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility), this page covers
info for creating apps that are both
adaptive _and_ accessible.


## Scroll wheel for custom widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#scroll-wheel-for-custom-widgets)

Scrolling widgets like `ScrollView` or `ListView`
support the scroll wheel by default, and because
almost every scrollable custom widget is built
using one of these, it works with those as well.


If you need to implement custom scroll behavior,
you can use the [`Listener`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Listener-class.html)
widget, which lets you
customize how your UI reacts to the scroll wheel.


dart

```
return Listener(
  onPointerSignal: (event) {
    if (event is PointerScrollEvent) print(event.scrollDelta.dy);
  },
  child: ListView(),
);
```

## Tab traversal and focus interactions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#tab-traversal-and-focus-interactions)

Users with physical keyboards expect that they can use
the tab key to quickly navigate an application,
and users with motor or vision differences often rely
completely on keyboard navigation.


There are two considerations for tab interactions:
how focus moves from widget to widget, known as traversal,
and the visual highlight shown when a widget is focused.


Most built-in components, like buttons and text fields,
support traversal and highlights by default.
If you have your own widget that you want included in
traversal, you can use the [`FocusableActionDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusableActionDetector-class.html)
widget
to create your own controls. The [`FocusableActionDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusableActionDetector-class.html)

widget is helpful for combining focus, mouse input,
and shortcuts together in one widget. You can create
a detector that defines actions and key bindings,
and provides callbacks for handling focus and hover highlights.


dart

```
class _BasicActionDetectorState extends State<BasicActionDetector> {
  bool _hasFocus = false;
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FocusableActionDetector(
      onFocusChange: (value) => setState(() => _hasFocus = value),
      actions: <Type, Action<Intent>>{
        ActivateIntent: CallbackAction<Intent>(
          onInvoke: (intent) {
            print('Enter or Space was pressed!');
            return null;
          },
        ),
      },
      child: Stack(
        clipBehavior: Clip.none,
        children: [\
          const FlutterLogo(size: 100),\
          // Position focus in the negative margin for a cool effect\
          if (_hasFocus)\
            Positioned(\
              left: -4,\
              top: -4,\
              bottom: -4,\
              right: -4,\
              child: _roundedBorder(),\
            ),\
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

### Controlling traversal order

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#controlling-traversal-order)

To get more control over the order that
widgets are focused on when the user tabs through,
you can use [`FocusTraversalGroup`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusTraversalGroup-class.html)
to define sections
of the tree that should be treated as a group when tabbing.


For example, you might to tab through all the fields in
a form before tabbing to the submit button:


dart

```
return Column(
  children: [\
    FocusTraversalGroup(child: MyFormWithMultipleColumnsAndRows()),\
    SubmitButton(),\
  ],
);
```

content\_copy

Flutter has several built-in ways to traverse widgets and groups,
defaulting to the `ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy` class.
This class usually works well, but it's possible to modify this
using another predefined `TraversalPolicy` class or by creating
a custom policy.


## Keyboard accelerators

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#keyboard-accelerators)

In addition to tab traversal, desktop and web users are accustomed
to having various keyboard shortcuts bound to specific actions.
Whether it's the `Delete` key for quick deletions or
`Control+N` for a new document, be sure to consider the different
accelerators your users expect. The keyboard is a powerful
input tool, so try to squeeze as much efficiency from it as you can.
Your users will appreciate it!


Keyboard accelerators can be accomplished in a few ways in Flutter,
depending on your goals.


If you have a single widget like a `TextField` or a `Button` that
already has a focus node, you can wrap it in a [`KeyboardListener`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/KeyboardListener-class.html)

or a [`Focus`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Focus-class.html)
widget and listen for keyboard events:


dart

```
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Focus(
      onKeyEvent: (node, event) {
        if (event is KeyDownEvent) {
          print(event.logicalKey);
        }
        return KeyEventResult.ignored;
      },
      child: ConstrainedBox(
        constraints: const BoxConstraints(maxWidth: 400),
        child: const TextField(
          decoration: InputDecoration(border: OutlineInputBorder()),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

To apply a set of keyboard shortcuts to a large section
of the tree, use the [`Shortcuts`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Shortcuts-class.html)
widget:


dart

```
// Define a class for each type of shortcut action you want
class CreateNewItemIntent extends Intent {
  const CreateNewItemIntent();
}
​
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Shortcuts(
    // Bind intents to key combinations
    shortcuts: const <ShortcutActivator, Intent>{
      SingleActivator(LogicalKeyboardKey.keyN, control: true):
          CreateNewItemIntent(),
    },
    child: Actions(
      // Bind intents to an actual method in your code
      actions: <Type, Action<Intent>>{
        CreateNewItemIntent: CallbackAction<CreateNewItemIntent>(
          onInvoke: (intent) => _createNewItem(),
        ),
      },
      // Your sub-tree must be wrapped in a focusNode, so it can take focus.
      child: Focus(autofocus: true, child: Container()),
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

The [`Shortcuts`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Shortcuts-class.html)
widget is useful because it only
allows shortcuts to be fired when this widget tree
or one of its children has focus and is visible.


The final option is a global listener. This listener
can be used for always-on, app-wide shortcuts or for
panels that can accept shortcuts whenever they're visible
(regardless of their focus state). Adding global listeners
is easy with [`HardwareKeyboard`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/HardwareKeyboard-class.html):


dart

```
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  HardwareKeyboard.instance.addHandler(_handleKey);
}
​
@override
void dispose() {
  HardwareKeyboard.instance.removeHandler(_handleKey);
  super.dispose();
}
```

content\_copy

To check key combinations with the global listener,
you can use the `HardwareKeyboard.instance.logicalKeysPressed` set.
For example, a method like the following can check whether any
of the provided keys are being held down:


dart

```
static bool isKeyDown(Set<LogicalKeyboardKey> keys) {
  return keys
      .intersection(HardwareKeyboard.instance.logicalKeysPressed)
      .isNotEmpty;
}
```

content\_copy

Putting these two things together,
you can fire an action when `Shift+N` is pressed:


dart

```
bool _handleKey(KeyEvent event) {
  bool isShiftDown = isKeyDown({
    LogicalKeyboardKey.shiftLeft,
    LogicalKeyboardKey.shiftRight,
  });
​
  if (isShiftDown && event.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.keyN) {
    _createNewItem();
    return true;
  }
​
  return false;
}
```

content\_copy

One note of caution when using the static listener,
is that you often need to disable it when the user
is typing in a field or when the widget it's
associated with is hidden from view.
Unlike with `Shortcuts` or `KeyboardListener`,
this is your responsibility to manage. This can be especially
important when you're binding a Delete/Backspace accelerator for
`Delete`, but then have child `TextFields` that the user
might be typing in.


## Mouse enter, exit, and hover for custom widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#custom-widgets)

On desktop, it's common to change the mouse cursor
to indicate the functionality about the content the
mouse is hovering over. For example, you typically see
a hand cursor when you hover over a button,
or an `I` cursor when you hover over text.


Flutter's Material buttons handle basic focus states
for standard button and text cursors.
(A notable exception is if you change the default styling
of the Material buttons to set the `overlayColor` to transparent.)


Implement a focus state for any custom buttons or
gesture detectors in your app.
If you change the default Material button styles,
test for keyboard focus states and
implement your own, if needed.


To change the cursor from within your custom widgets,
use [`MouseRegion`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MouseRegion-class.html):


dart

```
// Show hand cursor
return MouseRegion(
  cursor: SystemMouseCursors.click,
  // Request focus when clicked
  child: GestureDetector(
    onTap: () {
      Focus.of(context).requestFocus();
      _submit();
    },
    child: Logo(showBorder: hasFocus),
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

`MouseRegion` is also useful for creating custom
rollover and hover effects:


dart

```
return MouseRegion(
  onEnter: (_) => setState(() => _isMouseOver = true),
  onExit: (_) => setState(() => _isMouseOver = false),
  onHover: (e) => print(e.localPosition),
  child: Container(
    height: 500,
    color: _isMouseOver ? Colors.blue : Colors.black,
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

For an example that changes the button style
to outline the button when it has focus,
check out the [button code for the Wonderous app](https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-wonderous-app/blob/8a29d6709668980340b1b59c3d3588f123edd4d8/lib/ui/common/controls/buttons.dart#L143).
The app modifies the [`FocusNode.hasFocus`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusNode/hasFocus.html)

property to check whether the button has focus
and, if so, adds an outline.


## Visual density

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#visual-density)

You might consider enlarging the "hit area"
of a widget to accommodate a touch screen, for example.


Different input devices offer various levels of precision,
which necessitate differently-sized hit areas.
Flutter's `VisualDensity` class makes it easy to adjust the
density of your views across the entire application,
for example, by making a button larger
(and therefore easier to tap) on a touch device.


When you change the `VisualDensity` for
your `MaterialApp`, `MaterialComponents`
that support it animate their densities to match.
By default, both horizontal and vertical densities
are set to 0.0, but you can set the densities to any
negative or positive value that you want.
By switching between different
densities, you can easily adjust your UI.


![Adaptive scaffold](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/adaptive_scaffold.webp)

To set a custom visual density,
inject the density into your `MaterialApp` theme:


dart

```
double densityAmt = touchMode ? 0.0 : -1.0;
VisualDensity density = VisualDensity(
  horizontal: densityAmt,
  vertical: densityAmt,
);
return MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(visualDensity: density),
  home: MainAppScaffold(),
  debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
);
```

content\_copy

To use `VisualDensity` inside your own views,
you can look it up:


dart

```
VisualDensity density = Theme.of(context).visualDensity;
```

content\_copy

Not only does the container react automatically to changes
in density, it also animates when it changes.
This ties together your custom components,
along with the built-in components,
for a smooth transition effect across the app.


As shown, `VisualDensity` is unit-less,
so it can mean different things to different views.
In the following example, 1 density unit equals 6 pixels,
but this is totally up to you to decide.
The fact that it is unit-less makes it quite versatile,
and it should work in most contexts.


It's worth noting that the Material generally
use a value of around 4 logical pixels for each
visual density unit. For more information about the
supported components, see the [`VisualDensity`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/VisualDensity-class.html)
API.
For more information about density principles in general,
see the [Material Design guide](https://m2.material.io/design/layout/applying-density.html#usage).

## Introduction

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#introduction)

This page collects some common questions asked about
Flutter. You might also check out the following
specialized FAQs:


- [Web FAQ](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq)
- [Performance FAQ](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/faq)

### What is Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-is-flutter)

Flutter is Google's portable UI toolkit for crafting beautiful,
natively compiled applications for mobile, web,
and desktop from a single codebase.
Flutter works with existing code,
is used by developers and organizations around
the world, and is free and open source.


### Who is Flutter for?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#who-is-flutter-for)

For users, Flutter makes beautiful apps come to life.

For developers, Flutter lowers the bar to entry for building apps.
It speeds app development and reduces the cost and complexity
of app production across platforms.


For designers, Flutter provides a canvas for
high-end user experiences. Fast Company described
Flutter as [one of the top design ideas of the decade](https://www.fastcompany.com/90442092/the-14-most-important-design-ideas-of-the-decade-according-to-the-experts)
for
its ability to turn concepts into production code
without the compromises imposed by typical frameworks.
It also acts as a productive prototyping tool
with drag-and-drop tools like [FlutterFlow](https://flutterflow.io/)
and web-based IDEs like [Zapp!](https://zapp.run/).


For engineering managers and businesses,
Flutter allows the unification of app
developers into a single _mobile, web,_
_and desktop app team_, building branded
apps for multiple platforms out of a single codebase.
Flutter speeds feature development and synchronizes
release schedules across the entire customer base.


### How much development experience do I need to use Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#how-much-development-experience-do-i-need-to-use-flutter)

Flutter is approachable to programmers familiar with
object-oriented concepts (classes, methods, variables,
etc) and imperative programming concepts (loops,
conditionals, etc).


We have seen people with very little programming
experience learn and use Flutter for prototyping
and app development.


### What kinds of apps can I build with Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-kinds-of-apps-can-i-build-with-flutter)

Flutter is designed to support mobile apps that run
on both Android and iOS, as well as interactive apps
that you want to run on your web pages or on the desktop.


Apps that need to deliver highly branded designs
are particularly well suited for Flutter.
However, you can also create pixel-perfect experiences
that match the Android and iOS design languages with Flutter.


Flutter's [package ecosystem](https://pub.dev/flutter) supports a wide
variety of hardware (such as camera, GPS, network,
and storage) and services (such as payments, cloud
storage, authentication, and [ads](https://flutter.dev/monetization)).


### Who makes Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#who-makes-flutter)

Flutter is an open source project,
with contributions from Google and other
companies and individuals.


### Who uses Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#who-uses-flutter)

Developers inside and outside of Google use
Flutter to build beautiful natively-compiled
apps for iOS and Android. To learn about some
of these apps, visit the [showcase](https://flutter.dev/showcase).


### What makes Flutter unique?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-makes-flutter-unique)

Flutter is different than most other options
for building mobile apps because it doesn't rely
on web browser technology nor the set of widgets
that ship with each device. Instead, Flutter uses
its own high-performance rendering engine to draw widgets.


In addition, Flutter is different because it only
has a thin layer of C/C++ code. Flutter implements
most of its system (compositing, gestures, animation,
framework, widgets, etc) in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) (a modern,
concise, object-oriented language) that developers
can easily approach read, change, replace, or remove.
This gives developers tremendous control over the system,
as well as significantly lowers the bar to approachability
for the majority of the system.


### Should I build my next production app with Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#should-i-build-my-next-production-app-with-flutter)

[Flutter 1](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/12/flutter-10-googles-portable-ui-toolkit.html)
was launched on Dec 4th, 2018,
[Flutter 2](https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/announcing-flutter-2.html)
on March 3rd, 2021, and
[Flutter 3](https://developers.googleblog.com/flutter/introducing-flutter-3-5eb69151622f)
on May 10th, 2023.
As of May 2023, over _one million_ apps have shipped using
Flutter to many hundreds of millions of devices.
Check out some sample apps in the [showcase](https://flutter.dev/showcase).


Flutter ships updates on a roughly-quarterly
cadence that improve stability and performance
and address commonly-requested user features.

### Does Flutter come with a framework?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-come-with-a-framework)

Yes! Flutter ships with a modern react-style framework.
Flutter's framework is designed to be layered and
customizable (and optional). Developers can choose to
use only parts of the framework, or even replace
upper layers of the framework entirely.


### Does Flutter come with widgets?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-come-with-widgets)

Yes! Flutter ships with a set of
[high-quality Material Design and Cupertino\\
(iOS-style) widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets), layouts, and themes.
Of course, these widgets are only a starting point.
Flutter is designed to make it easy to create your own
widgets, or customize the existing widgets.


### Does Flutter support Material Design?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-support-material-design)

Yes! The Flutter and Material teams collaborate closely,
and Material is fully supported. For more information,
check out the Material 2 and Material 3 widgets
in the [widget catalog](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/material).


### Does Flutter come with a testing framework?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-come-with-a-testing-framework)

Yes, Flutter provides APIs for writing unit and
integration tests. Learn more about [testing with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/overview).


We use our own testing capabilities to test our SDK,
and we measure our [test coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/flutter/flutter?branch=master)
on every commit.


### Does Flutter come with debugging tools?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-come-with-debugging-tools)

Yes, Flutter comes with [Flutter DevTools](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools) (also
called Dart DevTools). For more information, see
[Debugging with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/debugging) and the [Flutter DevTools](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools)
docs.


### Does Flutter come with a dependency injection framework?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-come-with-a-dependency-injection-framework)

We don't ship with an opinionated solution,
but there are a variety of packages that offer
dependency injection and service location,
such as [injectable](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable), [get\_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it),
[kiwi](https://pub.dev/packages/kiwi), and [riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod).


## Technology

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#technology)

### What technology is Flutter built with?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-technology-is-flutter-built-with)

Flutter is built with C, C++, Dart,
Skia (a 2D rendering engine),
and [Impeller](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller) (the default rendering engine on iOS).
See this [architecture diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cw7A4HbvM_Abv320rVgPVGiUP2msVs7tfGbkgdrTy0I/edit#slide=id.gbb3c3233b_0_162)

for a better picture of the main components.
For a more detailed description of the layered architecture
of Flutter, read the [architectural overview](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview).


### How does Flutter run my code on Android?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#run-android)

The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with Android's NDK.
The Dart code (both the SDK's and yours)
are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into native, ARM, and x86-64
libraries. Those libraries are included in a "runner"
Android project, and the whole thing is built into an `.apk`.
When launched, the app loads the Flutter library.
Any rendering, input, or event handling, and so on,
is delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code.
This is similar to the way many game engines work.


During debug mode, Flutter uses a virtual machine (VM)
to run its code in order to enable stateful hot reload,
a feature that lets you make changes to your running code
without recompilation. You'll see a "debug" banner in
the top right-hand corner of your app when running in this mode,
to remind you that performance is not characteristic of
the finished release app.


### How does Flutter run my code on iOS?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#run-ios)

The engine's C and C++ code are compiled with LLVM.
The Dart code (both the SDK's and yours)
are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into a native, ARM library.
That library is included in a "runner" iOS project,
and the whole thing is built into an `.ipa`.
When launched, the app loads the Flutter library.
Any rendering, input or event handling, and so on,
are delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code.
This is similar to the way many game engines work.


During debug mode, Flutter uses a virtual machine (VM)
to run its code in order to enable stateful hot reload,
a feature that lets you make changes to your
running code without recompilation. You'll see
a "debug" banner in the top right-hand corner of
your app when running in this mode, to remind you that
performance is not characteristic of the finished release app.


### Does Flutter use my operating system's built-in platform widgets?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-use-my-operating-systems-built-in-platform-widgets)

No. Instead, Flutter provides a set of widgets
(including Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-styled) widgets),
managed and rendered by Flutter's framework and engine.
You can browse a [catalog of Flutter's widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets).


We believe that the end result is higher quality apps.
If we reused the built-in platform widgets,
the quality and performance of Flutter apps would be limited
by the flexibility and quality of those widgets.


In Android, for example, there's a hard-coded set
of gestures and fixed rules for disambiguating them.
In Flutter, you can write your own gesture recognizer
that is a first class participant in the [gesture system](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/gestures).
Moreover, two widgets authored by different people can
coordinate to disambiguate gestures.


Modern app design trends point towards designers and
users wanting more motion-rich UIs and brand-first designs.
In order to achieve that level of customized, beautiful design,
Flutter is architectured to drive pixels instead
of the built-in widgets.


By using the same renderer, framework, and set of widgets,
it's easier to publish for multiple platforms from the same
codebase, without having to do careful and costly planning
to align different feature sets and API characteristics.


By using a single language, a single framework,
and a single set of libraries for all of your code
(regardless if your UI is different for each platform or not),
we also aim to help lower app development and maintenance costs.


### What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new widgets?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-happens-when-my-mobile-os-updates-and-introduces-new-widgets)

The Flutter team watches the adoption and demand for new mobile
widgets from iOS and Android, and aims to work with the community
to build support for new widgets. This work might come in the form
of lower-level framework features, new composable widgets,
or new widget implementations.


Flutter's layered architecture is designed to support numerous
widget libraries, and we encourage and support the community in
building and maintaining widget libraries.


### What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new platform capabilities?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-happens-when-my-mobile-os-updates-and-introduces-new-platform-capabilities)

Flutter's interop and plugin system is designed to allow
developers to access new mobile OS features and capabilities
immediately. Developers don't have to wait for the Flutter team
to expose the new mobile OS capability.


### Does Flutter support code push?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-support-code-push)

Code push, or the ability to push app updates directly to a
user's device, isn't directly supported by Flutter.
However, we are aware of a third party solution,
called [Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev/).
Note that this is not an official endorsement or recommendation.


### What operating systems can I use to build a Flutter app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-operating-systems-can-i-use-to-build-a-flutter-app)

Flutter supports development using Linux, macOS, ChromeOS,
and Windows.


### What language is Flutter written in?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-language-is-flutter-written-in)

[Dart](https://dart.dev/), a fast-growing modern language optimized
for client apps. The underlying graphics framework
and the Dart virtual machine are implemented in C/C++.


### Why did Flutter choose to use Dart?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#why-did-flutter-choose-to-use-dart)

During the initial development phase,
the Flutter team looked at a lot of
languages and runtimes, and ultimately
adopted Dart for the framework and widgets.
Flutter used four primary dimensions for evaluation,
and considered the needs of framework authors,
developers, and end users. We found many languages
met some requirements, but Dart scored highly on
all of our evaluation dimensions and met all our
requirements and criteria.


Dart runtimes and compilers support the combination of
two critical features for Flutter: a JIT-based fast
development cycle that allows for shape changing and
stateful hot reloads in a language with types,
plus an Ahead-of-Time compiler that emits efficient
ARM code for fast startup and predictable performance of
production deployments.


In addition, we have the opportunity to work closely
with the Dart community, which is actively investing
resources in improving Dart for use in Flutter. For
example, when we adopted Dart,
the language didn't have an ahead-of-time
toolchain for producing native binaries,
which is instrumental in achieving predictable,
high performance, but now the language does because the Dart team
built it for Flutter. Similarly, the Dart VM has
previously been optimized for throughput but the
team is now optimizing the VM for latency, which is more
important for Flutter's workload.


Dart scores highly for us on the following primary criteria:

_Developer productivity_

One of Flutter's main value propositions is that it
saves engineering resources by letting developers
create apps for both iOS and Android with the same codebase.
Using a highly productive language accelerates
developers further and makes Flutter more attractive.
This was very important to both our framework team as
well as our developers. The majority of Flutter
is built in the same language we give to our users,
so we need to stay productive at 100k's lines of code,
without sacrificing approachability or
readability of the framework and widgets for our developers.


_Object-orientation_

For Flutter, we want a language that's suited to
Flutter's problem domain: creating visual user experiences.
The industry has multiple decades of experience building
user interface frameworks in object-oriented languages.
While we could use a non-object-oriented language,
this would mean reinventing the wheel to solve several
hard problems. Plus, the vast majority of developers
have experience with object-oriented development,
making it easier to learn how to develop with Flutter.


_Predictable, high performance_

With Flutter, we want to empower developers to create fast,
fluid user experiences. In order to achieve that, we need to
be able to run a significant amount of end-developer code
during every animation frame. That means we need a language
that both delivers high performance and predictable
performance, without periodic pauses that would cause
dropped frames.


_Fast allocation_

The Flutter framework uses a functional-style flow that
depends heavily on the underlying memory allocator
efficiently handling small, short-lived allocations.
This style was developed in languages with this
property and doesn't work efficiently in languages
that lack this facility.


### Can Flutter run any Dart code?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-flutter-run-any-dart-code)

Flutter can run Dart code that doesn't directly or
transitively import `dart:mirrors` or `dart:html`.


### Can Flutter compile Dart to JavaScript?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-flutter-compile-dart-to-javascript)

Flutter compiles Dart to JavaScript with the
[`js.dart`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile#js) package.


### How big is the Flutter engine?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#how-big-is-the-flutter-engine)

In March 2021, we measured the download size of a
[minimal Flutter app](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/75228a59dacc24f617272f7759677e242bbf74ec/examples/hello_world)
(no Material Components,
just a single `Center` widget, built with `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`), bundled and compressed as a release APK,
to be approximately 4.3 MB for ARM32, and 4.8 MB for ARM64.


On ARM32, the core engine is approximately 3.4 MB
(compressed), the framework + app code is approximately
765 KB (compressed), the LICENSE file is 58 KB
(compressed), and necessary Java code (`classes.dex`)
is 120 KB (compressed).


In ARM64, the core engine is approximately 4.0 MB
(compressed), the framework + app code is approximately
659 KB (compressed), the LICENSE file is 58 KB
(compressed), and necessary Java code (`classes.dex`)
is 120 KB (compressed).


These numbers were measured using [apkanalyzer](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apkanalyzer),
which is also [built into Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/apk-analyzer).


On iOS, a release IPA of the same app has a download
size of 10.9 MB on an iPhone X, as reported by Apple's
App Store Connect. The IPA is larger than the APK mainly
because Apple encrypts binaries within the IPA, making the
compression less efficient (see the
[iOS App Store Specific Considerations](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1795/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014195-CH1-APP_STORE_CONSIDERATIONS)

section of Apple's [QA1795](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1795/_index.html)).


Of course, we recommend that you measure your own app.
To do that, see [Measuring your app's size](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/app-size).


### How does Flutter define a pixel?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#how-does-flutter-define-a-pixel)

Flutter uses logical pixels,
and often refers to them merely as "pixels".
Flutter's [`devicePixelRatio`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-html/Window/devicePixelRatio.html)
expresses the ratio
between physical pixels and logical CSS pixels.


## Capabilities

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#capabilities)

### What kind of app performance can I expect?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-kind-of-app-performance-can-i-expect)

In general, you can expect excellent performance. Flutter is designed to help
developers easily achieve a constant 60fps. Flutter apps run using natively
compiled code, so no interpreters are involved. This means that Flutter apps
start quickly.


Flutter's performance when using native code depends on your
[app's architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture). For optimal performance, familiarize yourself with Flutter's
[platform channels](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels). These channels provide an asynchronous message-passing
system for communicating with native code.


To learn more about performance and Flutter, see the [Performance FAQ](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/faq).

### What kind of developer cycles can I expect? How long between edit and refresh?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#hot-reload)

Flutter implements a _hot reload_ developer cycle. You can expect
sub-second reload times, on a device or an emulator/simulator.


Flutter's hot reload is _stateful_ so the app state
is retained after a reload. This means you can quickly iterate
on a screen deeply nested in your app, without starting
from the home screen after every reload.


### How is _hot reload_ different from _hot restart_?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#how-is-hot-reload-different-from-hot-restart)

Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files
into the running Dart VM (Virtual Machine). This doesn't
only add new classes, but also adds methods and fields
to existing classes, and changes existing functions.
Hot restart resets the state to the app's initial state.


For more information, see [Hot reload](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/hot-reload).

### Where can I deploy my Flutter app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#where-can-i-deploy-my-flutter-app)

You can compile and deploy your Flutter app to iOS, Android,
[web](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web), and [desktop](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/desktop).


### What devices and OS versions does Flutter run on?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-devices-and-os-versions-does-flutter-run-on)

- We support and test running Flutter on a variety
of low-end to high-end platforms. For a detailed list
of the platforms on which we test, see
the list of [supported platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms).

- Flutter supports building ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled libraries
for `x86-64`, `armeabi-v7a`, and `arm64-v8a`.

- Apps built for ARMv7 or ARM64 run fine (using ARM emulation)
on many x86-64 Android devices.

- We support developing Flutter apps on a range of platforms.
See the system requirements listed under each
[development operating system](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started).


### Does Flutter run on the web?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-run-on-the-web)

Yes, web support is available in the stable channel.
For more details, check out the [web instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building).


### Can I use Flutter to build desktop apps?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-use-flutter-to-build-desktop-apps)

Yes, desktop support is in stable for Windows,
macOS, and Linux.


### Can I use Flutter inside of my existing native app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-use-flutter-inside-of-my-existing-native-app)

Yes, learn more in the [add-to-app](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app) section of our website.

### Can I access platform services and APIs like sensors and local storage?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-access-platform-services-and-apis-like-sensors-and-local-storage)

Yes. Flutter gives developers out-of-the-box access to _some_
platform-specific services and APIs from the operating system.
However, we want to avoid the "lowest common denominator" problem
with most cross-platform APIs, so we don't intend to build
cross-platform APIs for all native services and APIs.


A number of platform services and APIs have
[ready-made packages](https://pub.dev/flutter/) available on pub.dev.
Using an existing package [is easy](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages).


Finally, we encourage developers to use Flutter's
asynchronous message passing system to create your
own integrations with [platform and third-party APIs](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels).
Developers can expose as much or as little of the
platform APIs as they need, and build layers of
abstractions that are a best fit for their project.


### Can I extend and customize the bundled widgets?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-extend-and-customize-the-bundled-widgets)

Absolutely. Flutter's widget system was designed
to be easily customizable.


Rather than having each widget provide a large number of parameters,
Flutter embraces composition. Widgets are built out of smaller
widgets that you can reuse and combine in novel ways to make
custom widgets. For example, rather than subclassing a generic
button widget, `ElevatedButton` combines a Material widget with a
`GestureDetector` widget. The Material widget provides the visual
design and the `GestureDetector` widget provides the
interaction design.


To create a button with a custom visual design, you can combine
widgets that implement your visual design with a `GestureDetector`,
which provides the interaction design. For example,
`CupertinoButton` follows this approach and combines a
`GestureDetector` with several other widgets that implement its
visual design.


Composition gives you maximum control over the visual and
interaction design of your widgets while also allowing a
large amount of code reuse. In the framework, we've decomposed
complex widgets to pieces that separately implement
the visual, interaction, and motion design. You can remix
these widgets however you like to make your own custom
widgets that have full range of expression.


### Why would I want to share layout code across iOS and Android?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#why-would-i-want-to-share-layout-code-across-ios-and-android)

You can choose to implement different app layouts for
iOS and Android. Developers are free to check the mobile OS
at runtime and render different layouts,
though we find this practice to be rare.


More and more, we see mobile app layouts and designs evolving
to be more brand-driven and unified across platforms.
This implies a strong motivation to share layout and UI
code across iOS and Android.


The brand identity and customization of the app's
aesthetic design is now becoming more important than
strictly adhering to traditional platform aesthetics.
For example, app designs often require custom fonts, colors,
shapes, motion, and more in order to clearly convey their
brand identity.


We also see common layout patterns deployed across
iOS and Android. For example, the "bottom nav bar"
pattern can now be naturally found across iOS and Android.
There seems to be a convergence of design ideas
across mobile platforms.


### Can I interop with my mobile platform's default programming language?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-interop-with-my-mobile-platforms-default-programming-language)

Yes, Flutter supports calling into the platform,
including integrating with Java or Kotlin code on Android,
and Swift or Objective-C code on iOS.
This is enabled by a flexible message passing style
where a Flutter app might send and receive messages
to the mobile platform using a [`BasicMessageChannel`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/BasicMessageChannel-class.html).


Learn more about accessing platform and third-party services
in Flutter with [platform channels](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels).


Here is an [example project](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/examples/platform_channel)
that shows how to use a
platform channel to access battery state information on
iOS and Android.


### Does Flutter come with a reflection / mirrors system?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#does-flutter-come-with-a-reflection-mirrors-system)

No. Dart includes `dart:mirrors`,
which provides type reflection. But since
Flutter apps are pre-compiled for production,
and binary size is always a concern with mobile apps,
this library is unavailable for Flutter apps.


Using static analysis we can strip out anything that isn't
used ("tree shaking"). If you import a huge Dart library
but only use a self-contained two-line method,
then you only pay the cost of the two-line method,
even if that Dart library itself imports dozens and
dozens of other libraries. This guarantee is only secure
if Dart can identify the code path at compile time.
To date, we've found other approaches for specific needs
that offer a better trade-off, such as code generation.


### Are internationalization and localization supported?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#are-internationalization-and-localization-supported)

Yes, Flutter supports internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) so
that your apps are adaptable to different languages and cultures. You can
learn more in the [internationalization documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/internationalization).


### What accessibility is supported?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-accessibility-is-supported)

Flutter supports strict accessibility requirements (a11y). For example,
screen readers, large text, color contrast, and hardware switch control are
all supported. To learn more, see the [accessibility documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility).


### How do I write parallel and/or concurrent apps for Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#how-do-i-write-parallel-andor-concurrent-apps-for-flutter)

Flutter supports isolates. Isolates are separate heaps in
Flutter's VM, and they are able to run in parallel
(usually implemented as separate threads). Isolates
communicate by sending and receiving asynchronous messages.


Check out an [example of using isolates with Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/examples/layers/services/isolate.dart).


### Can I run Dart code in the background of a Flutter app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-run-dart-code-in-the-background-of-a-flutter-app)

Yes, you can run Dart code in a background process on both
iOS and Android. For more information, see the free Medium article
[Executing Dart in the Background with Flutter Plugins and Geofencing](https://blog.flutter.dev/executing-dart-in-the-background-with-flutter-plugins-and-geofencing-2b3e40a1a124).


### Can I use JSON/XML/Protobufs (and so on) with Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-use-jsonxmlwbrprotobufs-and-so-on-with-flutter)

Absolutely. There are libraries on
[pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) for JSON, XML, protobufs,
and many other utilities and formats.


For a detailed writeup on using JSON with Flutter,
check out the [JSON tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/serialization/json).


### Can I build 3D (OpenGL) apps with Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#can-i-build-3d-opengl-apps-with-flutter)

Today we don't support 3D using OpenGL ES or similar.
We have long-term plans to expose an optimized 3D API,
but right now we're focused on 2D.


### Why is my APK or IPA so big?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#why-is-my-apk-or-ipa-so-big)

Usually, assets including images, sound files, fonts, and so on,
are the bulk of an APK or IPA. Various tools in the
Android and iOS ecosystems can help you understand
what's inside of your APK or IPA.


Also, be sure to create a _release build_
of your APK or IPA with the Flutter tools.
A release build is usually _much_ smaller
than a _debug build_.


Learn more about creating a
[release build of your Android app](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android),
and creating a [release build of your iOS app](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios).
Also, check out [Measuring your app's size](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/app-size).


### Do Flutter apps run on Chromebooks?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#do-flutter-apps-run-on-chromebooks)

We have seen Flutter apps run on some Chromebooks.
We are tracking [issues related to running Flutter on\\
Chromebooks](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/labels/platform-arc).


### Is Flutter ABI compatible?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#is-flutter-abi-compatible)

Flutter and Dart don't offer application binary interface (ABI)
compatibility. Offering ABI compatibility is not a current
goal for Flutter or Dart.


### How does Flutter handle scrolling?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#how-does-flutter-handle-scrolling)

A custom scrolling implementation is used for each app platform so that
scrolling matches that platform's native scrolling look and feel. To learn
more about scrolling with Flutter, see the [scrolling](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/scrolling)
documentation.


## Framework

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#framework)

### Why is the build() method on State, rather than StatefulWidget?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#why-is-the-build-method-on-state-rather-than-statefulwidget)

Putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context)` method on `State`
rather putting a `Widget build(BuildContext context, State state)`
method on `StatefulWidget` gives developers more flexibility when
subclassing `StatefulWidget`. You can read a more
[detailed discussion on the API docs for `State.build`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/build.html).


### Where is Flutter's markup language? Why doesn't Flutter have a markup syntax?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#where-is-flutters-markup-language-why-doesnt-flutter-have-a-markup-syntax)

Flutter UIs are built with an imperative, object-oriented
language (Dart, the same language used to build Flutter's
framework). Flutter doesn't ship with a declarative markup.


We found that UIs dynamically built with code allow for
more flexibility. For example, we have found it difficult
for a rigid markup system to express and produce
customized widgets with bespoke behaviors.


We have also found that our "code-first" approach better allows
for features like hot reload and dynamic environment adaptations.


It's possible to create a custom language that is then
converted to widgets on the fly. Because build methods
are "just code", they can do anything,
including interpreting markup and turning it into widgets.


### My app has a Debug banner/ribbon in the upper right. Why am I seeing that?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#my-app-has-a-debug-bannerribbon-in-the-upper-right-why-am-i-seeing-that)

By default, the `flutter run` command uses the
debug build configuration.


The debug configuration runs your Dart code in a VM (Virtual Machine)
enabling a fast development cycle with [hot reload](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/hot-reload)
(release builds are compiled using the standard [Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#run-android)

and [iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#run-ios) toolchains).


The debug configuration also checks all asserts, which helps
you catch errors early during development, but imposes a
runtime cost. The "Debug" banner indicates that these checks
are enabled. You can run your app without these checks by
using either the `--profile` or `--release` flag to `flutter run`.


If your IDE uses the Flutter plugin,
you can launch the app in profile or release mode.
For VS Code, use the **Run > Start debugging**
or **Run > Run without debugging** menu entries.
For IntelliJ, use the menu entries
**Run > Flutter Run in Profile Mode** or **Release Mode**.


### What programming paradigm does Flutter's framework use?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-programming-paradigm-does-flutters-framework-use)

Flutter is a multi-paradigm programming environment.
Many programming techniques developed over the past few decades
are used in Flutter. We use each one where we believe
the strengths of the technique make it particularly well-suited.
In no particular order:


**Composition**

The primary paradigm used by Flutter is that of using
small objects with narrow scopes of behavior, composed together to
obtain more complicated effects, sometimes called
_aggressive composition_. Most widgets in the Flutter widget
library are built in this way. For example, the Material
[`TextButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextButton-class.html)
class is built using
an [`IconTheme`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/IconTheme-class.html), an
[`InkWell`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InkWell-class.html), a [`Padding`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Padding-class.html),
a [`Center`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html), a
[`Material`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Material-class.html),
an [`AnimatedDefaultTextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedDefaultTextStyle-class.html), and a
[`ConstrainedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ConstrainedBox-class.html).
The [`InkWell`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InkWell-class.html)
is built using a [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html).
The [`Material`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Material-class.html)
is built using an
[`AnimatedDefaultTextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedDefaultTextStyle-class.html),
a [`NotificationListener`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/NotificationListener-class.html), and an
[`AnimatedPhysicalModel`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AnimatedPhysicalModel-class.html).
And so on. It's widgets all the way down.


**Functional programming**

Entire applications can be built with only
[`StatelessWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html) s, which are essentially functions that
describe how arguments map to other functions, bottoming out
in primitives that compute layouts or paint graphics.
(Such applications can't easily have state,
so are typically non-interactive.) For example, the [`Icon`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon/icon.html)

widget is essentially a function that maps its arguments
( [`color`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon/color.html),
[`icon`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon/icon.html), [`size`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon/size.html)) into layout primitives.
Additionally, heavy use is made of immutable data structures,
including the entire [`Widget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html)
class
hierarchy as well as numerous supporting classes such as
[`Rect`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Rect-class.html)
and [`TextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html). On a smaller scale, Dart's
[`Iterable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Iterable-class.html)
API, which makes heavy use of the functional
style (map, reduce, where, etc), is frequently used to process
lists of values in the framework.


**Event-driven programming**

User interactions are represented by event objects
that are dispatched to callbacks registered with event handlers.
Screen updates are triggered by a similar callback mechanism. The
[`Listenable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html)
class, which is used as the basis of the
animation system, formalizes a subscription model for events
with multiple listeners.


**Class-based object-oriented programming**

Most of the APIs of the framework are built using classes
with inheritance. We use an approach whereby we define
very high-level APIs in our base classes, then specialize
them iteratively in subclasses. For example,
our render objects have a base class ( [`RenderObject`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html))
that is agnostic regarding the coordinate system,
and then we have a subclass ( [`RenderBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderBox-class.html))
that introduces the opinion that the geometry should be based
on the Cartesian coordinate system (x/width and y/height).


**Prototype-based object-oriented programming**

The [`ScrollPhysics`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ScrollPhysics-class.html)
class chains instances to compose
the physics that apply to scrolling dynamically at runtime.
This lets the system compose, for example, paging physics
with platform-specific physics, without the platform having to be
selected at compile time.


**Imperative programming**

Straightforward imperative programming, usually
paired with state encapsulated within an object,
is used where it provides the most intuitive solution.
For example, tests are written in an imperative style,
first describing the situation under test, then listing
the invariants that the test must match, then advancing
the clock or inserting events as necessary for the test.


**Reactive programming**

The widget and element trees are sometimes described as
reactive, because new inputs provided in a widget's
constructor are immediately propagated as changes to
lower-level widgets by the widget's build method, and
changes made in the lower widgets (for example,
in response to user input) propagate back up the tree
using event handlers. Aspects of both functional-reactive and
imperative-reactive are present in the framework,
depending on the needs of the widgets. Widgets with build
methods that consist of just an expression describing how
the widget reacts to changes in its configuration are functional
reactive widgets (for example, the Material [`Divider`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Divider-class.html)
class).
Widgets whose build methods construct a list of children
over several statements, describing how the widget reacts
to changes in its configuration, are imperative reactive
widgets (for example, the [`Chip`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Chip-class.html)
class).


**Declarative programming**

The build methods of widgets are often a single
expression with multiple levels of nested constructors,
written using a strictly declarative subset of Dart.
Such nested expressions could be mechanically transformed
to or from any suitably expressive markup language.
For example, the [`UserAccountsDrawerHeader`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/UserAccountsDrawerHeader-class.html)

widget has a long build method (20+ lines),
consisting of a single nested expression.
This can also be combined with the imperative style to build UIs
that would be harder to describe in a pure-declarative approach.


**Generic programming**

Types can be used to help developers catch programming
errors early. The Flutter framework uses generic programming to
help in this regard. For example, the [`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html)

class is parameterized in terms of the type of its
associated widget, so that the Dart analyzer can catch
mismatches of states and widgets. Similarly, the
[`GlobalKey`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GlobalKey-class.html)
class takes a type parameter so that it
can access a remote widget's state in a type-safe manner
(using runtime checking), the [`Route`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Route-class.html)
interface is
parameterized with the type that it is expected to use when
[popped](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator/pop.html), and collections such as
[`List`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/List-class.html) s, [`Map`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Map-class.html) s,
and [`Set`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/Set-class.html) s are all parameterized so that mismatched
elements can be caught early either during analysis or at
runtime during debugging.


**Concurrent programming**

Flutter makes heavy use of [`Future`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Future-class.html) s and other
asynchronous APIs. For example, the animation system reports
when an animation is finished by completing a future.
The image loading system similarly uses futures to report
when a load is complete.


**Constraint programming**

The layout system in Flutter uses a weak form of
constraint programming to determine the geometry of a scene.
Constraints (for example, for cartesian boxes, a minimum and
maximum width and a minimum and maximum height)
are passed from parent to child, and the child selects a resulting
geometry (for example, for cartesian boxes, a size,
specifically a width and a height) that fulfills those constraints.
By using this technique, Flutter can usually
lay out an entire scene with a single pass.

You can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).


### Which software license(s) apply to Flutter and its dependencies?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#which-software-licenses-apply-to-flutter-and-its-dependencies)

Flutter includes two components: an engine that ships as a
dynamically linked binary, and the Dart framework as a separate
binary that the engine loads. The engine uses multiple software
components with many dependencies; view the complete list
in its [license file](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/engine/src/flutter/sky/packages/sky_engine/LICENSE).


The framework is entirely self-contained and requires
[only one license](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/LICENSE).


In addition, any Dart packages you use might have their
own license requirements.


### How can I determine the licenses my Flutter application needs to show?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#how-can-i-determine-the-licenses-my-flutter-application-needs-to-show)

There's an API to find the list of licenses you need to show:

- If your application has a [`Drawer`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Drawer-class.html), add an
[`AboutListTile`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AboutListTile-class.html).

- If your application doesn't have a Drawer but does use the
Material Components library, call either [`showAboutDialog`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showAboutDialog.html)

or [`showLicensePage`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showLicensePage.html).

- For a more custom approach, you can get the raw licenses from the

### Who works on Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#who-works-on-flutter)

We all do! Flutter is an open source project.
Currently, the bulk of the development is done
by engineers at Google. If you're excited about Flutter,
we encourage you to join the community and
[contribute to Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!


### What are Flutter's guiding principles?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-are-flutters-guiding-principles)

We believe the following:

- In order to reach every potential user,
developers need to target multiple mobile platforms.

- HTML and WebViews as they exist today make it challenging to
consistently hit high frame rates and deliver
high-fidelity experiences, due to automatic behavior (scrolling,
layout) and legacy support.

- Today, it's too costly to build the same app multiple times: it
requires different teams, different code bases,
different workflows, different tools, etc.

- Developers want an easier, better way to use a single codebase to
build mobile apps for multiple target platforms,
and they don't want to sacrifice quality, control, or performance.


We are focused on three things:

_Control_

Developers deserve access to, and control over,
all layers of the system. Which leads to:


_Performance_

Users deserve perfectly fluid, responsive,
jank-free apps. Which leads to:


_Fidelity_:

Everyone deserves precise, beautiful, delightful
app experiences.


### Will Apple reject my Flutter app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#will-apple-reject-my-flutter-app)

We can't speak for Apple, but their App Store contains
many apps built with framework technologies such as Flutter.
Indeed, Flutter uses the same fundamental architectural
model as Unity, the engine that powers many of the
most popular games on the Apple store.


Apple has frequently featured well-designed apps
that are built with Flutter,
including [Hamilton](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hamilton-the-official-app/id1255231054?mt=8)
and [Reflectly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reflectly-journal-ai-diary/id1241229134).


As with any app submitted to the Apple store,
apps built with Flutter should follow Apple's
[guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) for App Store submission.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This article is intended to provide a high-level overview of the architecture of
Flutter, including the core principles and concepts that form its design.
If you are interested in how to architect a Flutter app,
check out [Architecting Flutter apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture).


Flutter is a cross-platform UI toolkit that is designed to allow code reuse
across operating systems such as iOS, Android, web, and desktop,
while also allowing
applications to interface directly with underlying platform services.
The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps
that feel natural on different platforms,
embracing differences where they exist while sharing as
much code as possible.


During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers
stateful hot reload of changes without needing a full recompile.
For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code,
whether Intel x64 or ARM instructions,
or to JavaScript if targeting the web.
The framework is open source, with a permissive BSD license,
and has a thriving ecosystem of third-party packages that
supplement the core library functionality.


This overview is divided into a number of sections:

1. The **layer model**: The pieces from which Flutter is constructed.
2. **Reactive user interfaces**: A core concept for Flutter user interface
    development.

3. An introduction to **widgets**: The fundamental building blocks
    of Flutter user interfaces.

4. The **rendering process**: How Flutter turns UI code into pixels.
5. An overview of the **platform embedders**: The code that lets mobile and
    desktop OSes execute Flutter apps.

6. **Integrating Flutter with other code**: Information about
    different techniques available to Flutter apps.

7. **Support for the web**: Concluding remarks about the characteristics of
    Flutter in a browser environment.


## Architectural layers

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#architectural-layers)

Flutter is designed as an extensible, layered system. It exists as a series of
independent libraries that each depend on the underlying layer. No layer has
privileged access to the layer below, and every part of the framework level is
designed to be optional and replaceable.


![Architectural diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/archdiagram.png)

To the underlying operating system, Flutter applications are packaged in the
same way as any other native application. A platform-specific embedder provides
an entrypoint; coordinates with the underlying operating system for access to
services like rendering surfaces, accessibility, and input; and manages the
message event loop. The embedder is written in a language that is appropriate
for the platform: currently Java and C++ for Android, Swift and
Objective-C/Objective-C++ for iOS and macOS,
and C++ for Windows and Linux. Using the embedder, Flutter
code can be integrated into an existing application as a module,
or the code might be the entire content of the application.
Flutter includes a number of embedders
for common target platforms, but other embedders also
exist.


At the core of Flutter is the **Flutter engine**,
which is mostly written in C++ and supports
the primitives necessary to support all Flutter applications.
The engine is responsible for rasterizing composited scenes
whenever a new frame needs to be painted.
It provides the low-level implementation of Flutter's core API,
including graphics text layout, file and network I/O, a Dart runtime,
and compile toolchain.


The engine is exposed to the Flutter framework through
[`dart:ui`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine/src/flutter/lib/ui),
which wraps the underlying C++ code in Dart classes. This library
exposes the lowest-level primitives, such as classes for driving input,
graphics, and text rendering subsystems.


Typically, developers interact with Flutter through the **Flutter framework**,
which provides a modern, reactive framework written in the Dart language. It
includes a rich set of platform, layout, and foundational libraries, composed of
a series of layers. Working from the bottom to the top, we have:


- Basic **[foundational](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/foundation-library.html)**

classes, and building block services such as
**[animation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/animation-library.html),**
**[painting](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/painting-library.html), and**
**[gestures](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/gestures-library.html)**
that offer
commonly used abstractions over the underlying foundation.

- The **[rendering\**\
**layer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/rendering-library.html)** provides an
abstraction for dealing with layout. With this layer, you can build a tree of
renderable objects. You can manipulate these objects dynamically, with the
tree automatically updating the layout to reflect your changes.

- The **[widgets layer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/widgets-library.html)**
is
a composition abstraction. Each render object in the rendering layer has a
corresponding class in the widgets layer. In addition, the widgets layer
allows you to define combinations of classes that you can reuse. This is the
layer at which the reactive programming model is introduced.

- The
**[Material](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html)**

and
**[Cupertino](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/cupertino-library.html)**

libraries offer comprehensive sets of controls that use the widget layer's
composition primitives to implement the Material or iOS design languages.


The Flutter framework is relatively small; many higher-level features that
developers might use are implemented as packages, including platform plugins
like [camera](https://pub.dev/packages/camera) and
[webview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter), as well as platform-agnostic
features like [characters](https://pub.dev/packages/characters),
[http](https://pub.dev/packages/http), and
[animations](https://pub.dev/packages/animations) that build upon the core Dart and
Flutter libraries. Some of these packages come from the broader ecosystem,
covering services like [in-app\\
payments](https://pub.dev/packages/square_in_app_payments), [Apple\\
authentication](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple), and
[animations](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie).


The rest of this overview broadly navigates down the layers, starting with the
reactive paradigm of UI development. Then, we describe how widgets are composed
together and converted into objects that can be rendered as part of an
application. We describe how Flutter interoperates with other code at a platform
level, before giving a brief summary of how Flutter's web support differs from
other targets.


## Anatomy of an app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#anatomy-of-an-app)

The following diagram gives an overview of the pieces
that make up a regular Flutter app generated by `flutter create`.
It shows where the Flutter Engine sits in this stack,
highlights API boundaries, and identifies the repositories
where the individual pieces live. The legend below clarifies
some of the terminology commonly used to describe the
pieces of a Flutter app.


![The layers of a Flutter app created by "flutter create": Dart app, framework, engine, embedder, runner](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-anatomy.svg)

**Dart App**

- Composes widgets into the desired UI.
- Implements business logic.
- Owned by app developer.

**Framework** ( [source code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/packages/flutter/lib))


- Provides higher-level API to build high-quality apps
(for example, widgets, hit-testing, gesture detection,
accessibility, text input).

- Composites the app's widget tree into a scene.

**Engine** ( [source code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine/src/flutter/shell/common))


- Responsible for rasterizing composited scenes.
- Provides low-level implementation of Flutter's core APIs
(for example, graphics, text layout, Dart runtime).

- Exposes its functionality to the framework using the **dart:ui API**.
- Integrates with a specific platform using the Engine's **Embedder API**.

**Embedder** ( [source code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform))


- Coordinates with the underlying operating system
for access to services like rendering surfaces,
accessibility, and input.

- Manages the event loop.
- Exposes **platform-specific API** to integrate the Embedder into apps.

**Runner**

- Composes the pieces exposed by the platform-specific
API of the Embedder into an app package runnable on the target platform.

- Part of app template generated by `flutter create`,
owned by app developer.


## Reactive user interfaces

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#reactive-user-interfaces)

On the surface, Flutter is [a reactive, declarative UI framework](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-programming-paradigm-does-flutters-framework-use),
in which the developer provides a mapping from application state to interface
state, and the framework takes on the task of updating the interface at runtime
when the application state changes. This model is inspired by
[work that came from Facebook for their own React framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=x7cQ3mrcKaY&feature=emb_logo),
which includes a rethinking of many traditional design principles.


In most traditional UI frameworks, the user interface's initial state is
described once and then separately updated by user code at runtime, in response
to events. One challenge of this approach is that, as the application grows in
complexity, the developer needs to be aware of how state changes cascade
throughout the entire UI. For example, consider the following UI:


![Color picker dialog](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/color-picker.png)

There are many places where the state can be changed: the color box, the hue
slider, the radio buttons. As the user interacts with the UI, changes must be
reflected in every other place. Worse, unless care is taken, a minor change to
one part of the user interface can cause ripple effects to seemingly unrelated
pieces of code.


One solution to this is an approach like MVC, where you push data changes to the
model through the controller, and then the model pushes the new state to the view
through the controller. However, this also is problematic, since creating and
updating UI elements are two separate steps that can easily get out of sync.


Flutter, along with other reactive frameworks, takes an alternative approach to
this problem, by explicitly decoupling the user interface from its underlying
state. With React-style APIs, you only create the UI description, and the
framework takes care of using that one configuration to both create and/or
update the user interface as appropriate.


In Flutter, widgets (akin to components in React) are represented by immutable
classes that are used to configure a tree of objects. These widgets are used to
manage a separate tree of objects for layout, which is then used to manage a
separate tree of objects for compositing. Flutter is, at its core, a series of
mechanisms for efficiently walking the modified parts of trees, converting trees
of objects into lower-level trees of objects, and propagating changes across
these trees.


A widget declares its user interface by overriding the `build()` method, which
is a function that converts state to UI:


```
UI = f(state)
```

content\_copy

The `build()` method is by design fast to execute and should be free of side
effects, allowing it to be called by the framework whenever needed (potentially
as often as once per rendered frame).


This approach relies on certain characteristics of a language runtime (in
particular, fast object instantiation and deletion). Fortunately, [Dart is\\
particularly well suited for this\\
task](https://blog.flutter.dev/flutter-dont-fear-the-garbage-collector-d69b3ff1ca30).


## Widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#widgets)

As mentioned, Flutter emphasizes widgets as a unit of composition. Widgets are
the building blocks of a Flutter app's user interface, and each widget is an
immutable declaration of part of the user interface.


Widgets form a hierarchy based on composition. Each widget nests inside its
parent and can receive context from the parent. This structure carries all the
way up to the root widget (the container that hosts the Flutter app, typically
`MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`), as this trivial example shows:


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
​
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());
​
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('My Home Page')),
        body: Center(
          child: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              return Column(
                children: [\
                  const Text('Hello World'),\
                  const SizedBox(height: 20),\
                  ElevatedButton(\
                    onPressed: () {\
                      print('Click!');\
                    },\
                    child: const Text('A button'),\
                  ),\
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

In the preceding code, all instantiated classes are widgets.

Apps update their user interface in response to events (such as a user
interaction) by telling the framework to replace a widget in the hierarchy with
another widget. The framework then compares the new and old widgets, and
efficiently updates the user interface.


Flutter has its own implementations of each UI control, rather than deferring to
those provided by the system: for example, there is a pure [Dart\\
implementation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoSwitch-class.html)
of both the [iOS Toggle\\
control](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toggles)
and the [one for](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Switch-class.html)
the
[Android equivalent](https://m3.material.io/components/switch).


This approach provides several benefits:

- Provides for unlimited extensibility. A developer who wants a variant of the
Switch control can create one in any arbitrary way, and is not limited to the
extension points provided by the OS.

- Avoids a significant performance bottleneck by allowing Flutter to composite
the entire scene at once, without transitioning back and forth between Flutter
code and platform code.

- Decouples the application behavior from any operating system dependencies. The
application looks and feels the same on all versions of the OS, even if the OS
changed the implementations of its controls.


### Composition

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#composition)

Widgets are typically composed of many other small, single-purpose widgets that
combine to produce powerful effects.


Where possible, the number of design concepts is kept to a minimum while
allowing the total vocabulary to be large. For example, in the widgets layer,
Flutter uses the same core concept (a `Widget`) to represent drawing to the
screen, layout (positioning and sizing), user interactivity, state management,
theming, animations, and navigation. In the animation layer, a pair of concepts,
`Animation`s and `Tween`s, cover most of the design space. In the rendering
layer, `RenderObject`s are used to describe layout, painting, hit testing, and
accessibility. In each of these cases, the corresponding vocabulary ends up
being large: there are hundreds of widgets and render objects, and dozens of
animation and tween types.


The class hierarchy is deliberately shallow and broad to maximize the possible
number of combinations, focusing on small, composable widgets that each do one
thing well. Core features are abstract, with even basic features like padding
and alignment being implemented as separate components rather than being built
into the core. (This also contrasts with more traditional APIs where features
like padding are built in to the common core of every layout component.) So, for
example, to center a widget, rather than adjusting a notional `Align` property,
you wrap it in a [`Center`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html)

widget.


There are widgets for padding, alignment, rows, columns, and grids. These layout
widgets do not have a visual representation of their own. Instead, their sole
purpose is to control some aspect of another widget's layout. Flutter also
includes utility widgets that take advantage of this compositional approach.


For example, [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html), a
commonly used widget, is made up of several widgets responsible for layout,
painting, positioning, and sizing. Specifically, `Container` is made up of the
[`LimitedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LimitedBox-class.html),
[`ConstrainedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ConstrainedBox-class.html),
[`Align`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Align-class.html),
[`Padding`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Padding-class.html),
[`DecoratedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DecoratedBox-class.html), and
[`Transform`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Transform-class.html)
widgets, as you
can see by reading its source code. A defining characteristic of Flutter is that
you can drill down into the source for any widget and examine it. So, rather
than subclassing `Container` to produce a customized effect, you can compose it
and other widgets in novel ways, or just create a new widget using
`Container` as inspiration.


### Building widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#building-widgets)

As mentioned earlier, you determine the visual representation of a widget by
overriding the
[`build()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html)
function to
return a new element tree. This tree represents the widget's part of the user
interface in more concrete terms. For example, a toolbar widget might have a
build function that returns a [horizontal\\
layout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html) of some
[text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) and
[various](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html) [buttons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/PopupMenuButton-class.html). As needed,
the framework recursively asks each widget to build until the tree is entirely
described by [concrete renderable\\
objects](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RenderObjectWidget-class.html). The
framework then stitches together the renderable objects into a renderable object
tree.


A widget's build function should be free of side effects. Whenever the function
is asked to build, the widget should return a new tree of widgets[1](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fn-1),
regardless of what the widget previously returned. The
framework does the heavy lifting work to determine which build methods need to
be called based on the render object tree (described in more detail later). More
information about this process can be found in the [Inside Flutter\\
topic](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter#linear-reconciliation).


On each rendered frame, Flutter can recreate just the parts of the UI where the
state has changed by calling that widget's `build()` method. Therefore it is
important that build methods should return quickly, and heavy computational work
should be done in some asynchronous manner and then stored as part of the state
to be used by a build method.


While relatively naive in approach, this automated comparison is quite
effective, enabling high-performance, interactive apps. And, the design of the
build function simplifies your code by focusing on declaring what a widget is
made of, rather than the complexities of updating the user interface from one
state to another.


### Widget state

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#widget-state)

The framework introduces two major classes of widget: _stateful_ and _stateless_
widgets.


Many widgets have no mutable state: they don't have any properties that change
over time (for example, an icon or a label). These widgets subclass
[`StatelessWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html).


However, if the unique characteristics of a widget needs to change based on user
interaction or other factors, that widget is _stateful_. For example, if a
widget has a counter that increments whenever the user taps a button, then the
value of the counter is the state for that widget. When that value changes, the
widget needs to be rebuilt to update its part of the UI. These widgets subclass
[`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html), and
(because the widget itself is immutable) they store mutable state in a separate
class that subclasses [`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html).
`StatefulWidget`s don't have a build method; instead, their user interface is
built through their `State` object.


Whenever you mutate a `State` object (for example, by incrementing the counter),
you must call [`setState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html)

to signal the framework to update the user interface by calling the `State`'s
build method again.


Having separate state and widget objects lets other widgets treat both stateless
and stateful widgets in exactly the same way, without being concerned about
losing state. Instead of needing to hold on to a child to preserve its state,
the parent can create a new instance of the child at any time without losing the
child's persistent state. The framework does all the work of finding and reusing
existing state objects when appropriate.


### State management

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#state-management)

So, if many widgets can contain state, how is state managed and passed around
the system?


As with any other class,
you can use a constructor in a widget to initialize its data,
so a `build()` method can ensure that any child widget
is instantiated with the data it needs:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   return ContentWidget(importantState);
}
```

content\_copy

Where `importantState` is a placeholder for the class
that contains the state important to the `Widget`.


As widget trees get deeper, however,
passing state information up and down the
tree hierarchy becomes cumbersome.
So, a third widget type, [`InheritedWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html),
provides an easy way to grab data from a shared ancestor.
You can use `InheritedWidget` to create a state widget
that wraps a common ancestor in the
widget tree, as shown in this example:


![Inherited widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/inherited-widget.png)

Whenever one of the `ExamWidget` or `GradeWidget` objects needs data from
`StudentState`, it can now access it with a command such as:


dart

```
final studentState = StudentState.of(context);
```

content\_copy

The `of(context)` call takes the build context
(a handle to the current widget location),
and returns [the nearest ancestor in the tree](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext/dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType.html)

that matches the `StudentState` type.
`InheritedWidget`s also offer an `updateShouldNotify()` method,
which Flutter calls to determine whether a state
change should trigger a rebuild of child widgets that use it.


Flutter itself uses `InheritedWidget` extensively as part
of the framework for shared state,
such as the application's _visual theme_, which includes
[properties like color and type styles](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html)
that are
pervasive throughout an application.
The `MaterialApp``build()` method inserts a theme
in the tree when it builds, and then deeper in the hierarchy a widget
can use the `.of()` method to look up the relevant theme data.


For example:

dart

```
Container(
  color: Theme.of(context).secondaryHeaderColor,
  child: Text(
    'Text with a background color',
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge,
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

As applications grow, more advanced state management approaches that reduce the
ceremony of creating and using stateful widgets become more attractive. Many
Flutter apps use utility packages like
[provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), which provides a wrapper around
`InheritedWidget`. Flutter's layered architecture also enables alternative
approaches to implement the transformation of state into UI, such as the
[flutter\_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) package.


## Rendering and layout

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#rendering-and-layout)

This section describes the rendering pipeline, which is the series of steps that
Flutter takes to convert a hierarchy of widgets into the actual pixels painted
onto a screen.


### Flutter's rendering model

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#flutters-rendering-model)

You might be wondering: if Flutter is a cross-platform framework,
then how can it offer comparable performance to
single-platform frameworks?


It's useful to start by thinking about how traditional
Android apps work. When drawing,
you first call the Java code of the Android framework.
The Android system libraries provide the components
responsible for drawing themselves to a `Canvas` object,
which Android can then render with [Skia](https://skia.org/),
a graphics engine written in C/C++ that calls the
CPU or GPU to complete the drawing on the device.


Cross-platform frameworks _typically_ work by creating
an abstraction layer over the underlying native
Android and iOS UI libraries, attempting to smooth out the
inconsistencies of each platform representation.
App code is often written in an interpreted language like JavaScript,
which must in turn interact with the Java-based
Android or Objective-C-based iOS system libraries to display UI.
All this adds overhead that can be significant,
particularly where there is a lot of
interaction between the UI and the app logic.


By contrast, Flutter minimizes those abstractions,
bypassing the system UI widget libraries in favor
of its own widget set. The Dart code that paints
Flutter's visuals is compiled into native code,
which uses Impeller for rendering.
Impeller is shipped along with the application,
allowing the developer to upgrade their app to stay
updated with the latest performance improvements
even if the phone hasn't been updated with a new Android version.
The same is true for Flutter on other native platforms,
such as Windows or macOS.


### From user input to the GPU

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#from-user-input-to-the-gpu)

The overriding principle that Flutter applies to its
rendering pipeline is that **simple is fast**.
Flutter has a straightforward pipeline for how data flows to
the system, as shown in the following sequencing diagram:


![Render pipeline sequencing diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/render-pipeline.png)

Let's take a look at some of these phases in greater detail.

### Build: from Widget to Element

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#build-from-widget-to-element)

Consider this code fragment that demonstrates a widget hierarchy:

dart

```
Container(

  ),

When Flutter needs to render this fragment,
it calls the `build()` method, which
returns a subtree of widgets that renders
UI-based on the current app state.
During this process,
the `build()` method can introduce new widgets,
as necessary, based on its state.
As an example, in the preceding code fragment,
`Container` has `color` and `child` properties.
From looking at the [source\\
code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/02efffc134ab4ce4ff50a9ddd86c832efdb80462/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/container.dart#L401)
for `Container`, you can see that if the color is not null,
it inserts a `ColoredBox` representing the color:


dart

```
if (color != null)
  current = ColoredBox(color: color!, child: current);
```

content\_copy

Correspondingly, the `Image` and `Text` widgets might insert child widgets such
as `RawImage` and `RichText` during the build process. The eventual widget
hierarchy might therefore be deeper than what the code represents,
as in this case[2](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fn-2):


![Render pipeline sequencing diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/widgets.png)

This explains why, when you examine the tree through
a debug tool such as the
[Flutter inspector](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/inspector),
part of the Flutter/Dart DevTools,
you might see a structure that is considerably deeper than what
is in your original code.


During the build phase, Flutter translates the widgets expressed in code into a
corresponding **element tree**, with one element for every widget. Each element
represents a specific instance of a widget in a given location of the tree
hierarchy. There are two basic types of elements:


- `ComponentElement`, a host for other elements.
- `RenderObjectElement`, an element that participates in the layout or paint
phases.


![Render pipeline sequencing diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/widget-element.png)

`RenderObjectElement`s are an intermediary between their widget analog and the
underlying `RenderObject`, which we'll come to later.


The element for any widget can be referenced through its `BuildContext`, which
is a handle to the location of a widget in the tree. This is the `context`
in a
function call such as `Theme.of(context)`, and is supplied to the `build()`

method as a parameter.


Because widgets are immutable, including the parent/child relationship between
nodes, any change to the widget tree (such as changing `Text('A')` to
`Text('B')` in the preceding example) causes a new set of widget objects to be
returned. But that doesn't mean the underlying representation must be rebuilt.
The element tree is persistent from frame to frame, and therefore plays a
critical performance role, allowing Flutter to act as if the widget hierarchy is
fully disposable while caching its underlying representation. By only walking
through the widgets that changed, Flutter can rebuild just the parts of the
element tree that require reconfiguration.


### Layout and rendering

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#layout-and-rendering)

It would be a rare application that drew only a single widget. An important part
of any UI framework is therefore the ability to efficiently lay out a hierarchy
of widgets, determining the size and position of each element before they are
rendered on the screen.


The base class for every node in the render tree is
[`RenderObject`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html), which
defines an abstract model for layout and painting. This is extremely general: it
does not commit to a fixed number of dimensions or even a Cartesian coordinate
system (demonstrated by [this example of a polar coordinate\\
system](https://dartpad.dev/?id=596b1d6331e3b9d7b00420085fab3e27)). Each
`RenderObject` knows its parent, but knows little about its children other than
how to _visit_ them and their constraints. This provides `RenderObject`
with
sufficient abstraction to be able to handle a variety of use cases.


During the build phase, Flutter creates or updates an object that inherits from
`RenderObject` for each `RenderObjectElement` in the element tree.
`RenderObject`s are primitives:
[`RenderParagraph`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderParagraph-class.html)

renders text,
[`RenderImage`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderImage-class.html)
renders
an image, and
[`RenderTransform`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderTransform-class.html)

applies a transformation before painting its child.


![Differences between the widgets hierarchy and the element and render trees](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/trees.png)

Most Flutter widgets are rendered by an object that inherits from the
`RenderBox` subclass, which represents a `RenderObject` of fixed size in a 2D
Cartesian space. `RenderBox` provides the basis of a _box constraint model_,
establishing a minimum and maximum width and height for each widget to be
rendered.


To perform layout, Flutter walks the render tree in a depth-first traversal and
**passes down size constraints** from parent to child. In determining its size,
the child _must_ respect the constraints given to it by its parent. Children
respond by **passing up a size** to their parent object within the constraints
the parent established.


![Constraints go down, sizes go up](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/constraints-sizes.png)

At the end of this single walk through the tree, every object has a defined size
within its parent's constraints and is ready to be painted by calling the
[`paint()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject/paint.html)

method.


The box constraint model is very powerful as a way to layout objects in _O(n)_
time:


- Parents can dictate the size of a child object by setting maximum and minimum
constraints to the same value. For example, the topmost render object in a
phone app constrains its child to be the size of the screen. (Children can
choose how to use that space. For example, they might just center what they
want to render within the dictated constraints.)

- A parent can dictate the child's width but give the child flexibility over
height (or dictate height but offer flexibility over width). A real-world example
is flow text, which might have to fit a horizontal constraint but vary
vertically depending on the quantity of text.


This model works even when a child object needs to know how much space it has
available to decide how it will render its content. By using a
[`LayoutBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html)
widget,
the child object can examine the passed-down constraints and use those to
determine how it will use them, for example:


dart

```
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (context, constraints) {
      if (constraints.maxWidth < 600) {
        return const OneColumnLayout();
      } else {
        return const TwoColumnLayout();
      }
    },
  );
}
```

content\_copy

More information about the constraint and layout system,
along with working examples, can be found in the
[Understanding constraints](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/constraints) topic.


The root of all `RenderObject`s is the `RenderView`, which represents the total
output of the render tree. When the platform demands a new frame to be rendered
(for example, because of a
[vsync](https://source.android.com/devices/graphics/implement-vsync) or because
a texture decompression/upload is complete), a call is made to the
`compositeFrame()` method, which is part of the `RenderView`
object at the root
of the render tree. This creates a `SceneBuilder` to trigger an update of the
scene. When the scene is complete, the `RenderView` object passes the composited
scene to the `Window.render()` method in `dart:ui`, which passes control to the
GPU to render it.


Further details of the composition and rasterization stages of the pipeline are
beyond the scope of this high-level article, but more information can be found
[in this talk on the Flutter rendering\\
pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUfXWzp0-DU).


## Platform embedding

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#platform-embedding)

As we've seen, rather than being translated into the equivalent OS widgets,
Flutter user interfaces are built, laid out, composited, and painted by Flutter
itself. The mechanism for obtaining the texture and participating in the app
lifecycle of the underlying operating system inevitably varies depending on the
unique concerns of that platform. The engine is platform-agnostic,
presenting a [stable ABI (Application Binary Interface)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/embedder/embedder.h).
that provides a _platform embedder_ with a way to set up and use Flutter.


The platform embedder is the native OS application that hosts all Flutter
content, and acts as the glue between the host operating system and Flutter.
When you start a Flutter app, the embedder provides the entrypoint,
initializes the Flutter engine, obtains threads for UI and rastering,
and creates a texture that Flutter can write to.
The embedder is also responsible for the app lifecycle,
including input gestures (such as mouse, keyboard, touch), window
sizing, thread management, and platform messages.
Flutter includes platform embedders for Android, iOS, Windows,
macOS, and Linux; you can also create a
custom platform embedder, as in [this worked\\
example](https://github.com/chinmaygarde/fluttercast) that supports remoting
Flutter sessions through a VNC-style framebuffer or [this worked example for\\
Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi).


Each platform has its own set of APIs and constraints. Some brief
platform-specific notes:


- As of Flutter 3.29, the UI and platform threads are merged on
iOS and Android. Specifically, the UI thread
is removed and the Dart code runs on the native platform thread.
For more information, see [The great thread merge](https://youtu.be/miW7vCmQwnw?si=9EYvRDxtkpkPrcSO)
video.

- On iOS and macOS, Flutter is loaded into the embedder as a `UIViewController`
or `NSViewController`, respectively. The platform embedder creates a
`FlutterEngine`, which serves as a host to the Dart VM and your Flutter
runtime, and a `FlutterViewController`, which attaches to the `FlutterEngine`

to pass UIKit or Cocoa input events into Flutter and to display frames
rendered by the `FlutterEngine` using Metal or OpenGL.

- On Android, Flutter is, by default, loaded into the embedder as an `Activity`.
The view is controlled by a
[`FlutterView`](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/embedding/android/FlutterView.html),
which renders Flutter content either as a view or a texture, depending on the
composition and z-ordering requirements of the Flutter content.

- On Windows, Flutter is hosted in a traditional Win32 app, and content is
rendered using
[ANGLE](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/master/README.md), a
library that translates OpenGL API calls to the DirectX 11 equivalents.


## Integrating with other code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#integrating-with-other-code)

Flutter provides a variety of interoperability mechanisms, whether you're
accessing code or APIs written in a language like Kotlin or Swift, calling a
native C-based API, embedding native controls in a Flutter app, or embedding
Flutter in an existing application.


### Platform channels

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#platform-channels)

For mobile and desktop apps, Flutter allows you to call into custom code through
a _platform channel_, which is a mechanism for communicating between your
Dart code and the platform-specific code of your host app. By creating a common
channel (encapsulating a name and a codec), you can send and receive messages
between Dart and a platform component written in a language like Kotlin or
Swift. Data is serialized from a Dart type like `Map` into a standard format,
and then deserialized into an equivalent representation in Kotlin (such as
`HashMap`) or Swift (such as `Dictionary`).


![How platform channels allow Flutter to communicate with host code](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/platform-channels.png)

The following is a short platform channel example of a Dart call to a receiving
event handler in Kotlin (Android) or Swift (iOS):


dart

```
// Dart side
const channel = MethodChannel('foo');
final greeting = await channel.invokeMethod('bar', 'world') as String;
print(greeting);
```

content\_copy

kotlin

```
// Android (Kotlin)
val channel = MethodChannel(flutterView, "foo")
channel.setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->
  when (call.method) {
    "bar" -> result.success("Hello, ${call.arguments}")
    else -> result.notImplemented()
  }
}
```

content\_copy

swift

```
// iOS (Swift)
let channel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: "foo", binaryMessenger: flutterView)
channel.setMethodCallHandler {
  (call: FlutterMethodCall, result: FlutterResult) -> Void in
  switch (call.method) {
    case "bar": result("Hello, \(call.arguments as! String)")
    default: result(FlutterMethodNotImplemented)
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Further examples of using platform channels, including examples for desktop
platforms, can be found in the [flutter/packages](https://github.com/flutter/packages)

repository. There are also [thousands of plugins\\
already available](https://pub.dev/flutter) for Flutter that cover many common
scenarios, ranging from Firebase to ads to device hardware like camera and
Bluetooth.


### Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#foreign-function-interface-ffi)

For C-based APIs, including those that can be generated for code written in
modern languages like Rust or Go, Dart provides a direct mechanism for binding
to native code using the `dart:ffi` library. The foreign function interface
(FFI) model can be considerably faster than platform channels, because no
serialization is required to pass data. Instead, the Dart runtime provides the
ability to allocate memory on the heap that is backed by a Dart object and make
calls to statically or dynamically linked libraries. FFI is available for all
platforms other than web, where the [JS interop libraries](https://dart.dev/interop/js-interop)
and
[`package:web`](https://pub.dev/packages/web) serve a similar purpose.


To use FFI, you create a `typedef` for each of the Dart and unmanaged method
signatures, and instruct the Dart VM to map between them. As an example,
here's a fragment of code to call the traditional Win32 `MessageBox()` API:


dart

```
import 'dart:ffi';
import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart'; // contains .toNativeUtf16() extension method
​
typedef MessageBoxNative =
    Int32 Function(
      IntPtr hWnd,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpText,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpCaption,
      Int32 uType,
    );
​
typedef MessageBoxDart =
    int Function(
      int hWnd,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpText,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpCaption,
      int uType,
    );
​
void exampleFfi() {
  final user32 = DynamicLibrary.open('user32.dll');
  final messageBox = user32.lookupFunction<MessageBoxNative, MessageBoxDart>(
    'MessageBoxW',
  );
​
  final result = messageBox(
    0, // No owner window
    'Test message'.toNativeUtf16(), // Message
    'Window caption'.toNativeUtf16(), // Window title
    0, // OK button only
  );
}
```

### Rendering native controls in a Flutter app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#rendering-native-controls-in-a-flutter-app)

Because Flutter content is drawn to a texture and its widget tree is entirely
internal, there's no place for something like an Android view to exist within
Flutter's internal model or render interleaved within Flutter widgets. That's a
problem for developers that would like to include existing platform components
in their Flutter apps, such as a browser control.


Flutter solves this by introducing platform view widgets
( [`AndroidView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AndroidView-class.html)

and [`UiKitView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/UiKitView-class.html))
that let you embed this kind of content on each platform. Platform views can be
integrated with other Flutter content[3](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fn-3). Each of
these widgets acts as an intermediary to the underlying operating system. For
example, on Android, `AndroidView` serves three primary functions:


- Making a copy of the graphics texture rendered by the native view and
presenting it to Flutter for composition as part of a Flutter-rendered surface
each time the frame is painted.

- Responding to hit testing and input gestures, and translating those into the
equivalent native input.

- Creating an analog of the accessibility tree, and passing commands and
responses between the native and Flutter layers.


Inevitably, there is a certain amount of overhead associated with this
synchronization. In general, therefore, this approach is best suited for complex
controls like Google Maps where reimplementing in Flutter isn't practical.


Typically, a Flutter app instantiates these widgets in a `build()` method based
on a platform test. As an example, from the
[google\_maps\_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) plugin:


dart

```
if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android) {
  return AndroidView(
    viewType: 'plugins.flutter.io/google_maps',
    onPlatformViewCreated: onPlatformViewCreated,
    gestureRecognizers: gestureRecognizers,
    creationParams: creationParams,
    creationParamsCodec: const StandardMessageCodec(),
  );
} else if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS) {
  return UiKitView(
    viewType: 'plugins.flutter.io/google_maps',
    onPlatformViewCreated: onPlatformViewCreated,
    gestureRecognizers: gestureRecognizers,
    creationParams: creationParams,
    creationParamsCodec: const StandardMessageCodec(),
  );
}
return Text(
  '$defaultTargetPlatform is not yet supported by the maps plugin',
);
```

content\_copy

Communicating with the native code underlying the `AndroidView` or `UiKitView`
typically occurs using the platform channels mechanism, as previously described.


At present, platform views aren't available for desktop platforms, but this is
not an architectural limitation; support might be added in the future.


### Hosting Flutter content in a parent app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#hosting-flutter-content-in-a-parent-app)

The converse of the preceding scenario is embedding a Flutter widget in an
existing Android or iOS app. As described in an earlier section, a newly created
Flutter app running on a mobile device is hosted in an Android activity or iOS
`UIViewController`. Flutter content can be embedded into an existing Android or
iOS app using the same embedding API.


The Flutter module template is designed for easy embedding; you can either embed
it as a source dependency into an existing Gradle or Xcode build definition, or
you can compile it into an Android Archive or iOS Framework binary for use
without requiring every developer to have Flutter installed.


The Flutter engine takes a short while to initialize, because it needs to load
Flutter shared libraries, initialize the Dart runtime, create and run a Dart
isolate, and attach a rendering surface to the UI. To minimize any UI delays
when presenting Flutter content, it's best to initialize the Flutter engine
during the overall app initialization sequence, or at least ahead of the first
Flutter screen, so that users don't experience a sudden pause while the first
Flutter code is loaded. In addition, separating the Flutter engine allows it to
be reused across multiple Flutter screens and share the memory overhead involved
with loading the necessary libraries.


More information about how Flutter is loaded into an existing Android or iOS app
can be found at the [Load sequence, performance and memory\\
topic](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/performance).


## Flutter web support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#flutter-web-support)

While the general architectural concepts apply to all platforms that Flutter
supports, there are some unique characteristics of Flutter's web support that
are worthy of comment.


Dart has been compiling to JavaScript for as long as the language has existed,
with a toolchain optimized for both development and production purposes.
Many important apps compile from Dart to JavaScript and run in production today,
including the [advertiser tooling for Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/).
Because the Flutter framework is written in Dart, compiling it to JavaScript
was relatively straightforward.


However, the Flutter engine, written in C++,
is designed to interface with the
underlying operating system rather than a web browser.
A different approach is therefore required.


On the web, Flutter offers two renderers:

| Renderer | Compilation target |
| --- | --- |
| CanvasKit | JavaScript |
| Skwasm | WebAssembly |

_Build modes_ are command-line options that dictate
which renderers are available when you run the app.


Flutter offers two _build_ modes:

| Build mode | Available renderer(s) |
| --- | --- |
| default | CanvasKit |
| \`--wasm\` | Skwasm (preferred), CanvasKit (fallback) |

The default mode makes only CanvasKit renderer available.
The `--wasm` option makes both renderers available,
and chooses the engine based on browser capabilities:
preferring Skwasm if the browser is capable of running it,
and falls back to CanvasKit otherwise.


![Flutter web architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/web-framework-diagram.png)

Perhaps the most notable difference compared to other
platforms on which Flutter runs is that there is no need
for Flutter to provide a Dart runtime.
Instead, the Flutter framework (along with any code you write)
is compiled to JavaScript.
It's also worthy to note that Dart has very few language
semantic differences across all of its modes
(JIT versus AOT, native versus web compilation),
and most developers will never write a line of code that
runs into such a difference.


During development time, Flutter web uses
[`dartdevc`](https://dart.dev/tools/dartdevc),
a compiler that supports incremental compilation
and therefore allows hot restart and
\[hot reload behind a flag\]\[\].
Conversely, when you are ready to create a production app
for the web, [`dart2js`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart2js),
Dart's highly-optimized production JavaScript compiler is used,
packaging the Flutter core and framework along with your
application into a minified source file that
can be deployed to any web server.
Code can be offered in a single file or split
into multiple files through [deferred imports](https://dart.dev/language/libraries#lazily-loading-a-library).


For more information on Flutter web, check out
[Web support for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web) and [Web renderers](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/renderers).


## Further information

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#further-information)

For those interested in more information about the internals of Flutter,
the [Inside Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter) whitepaper
provides a useful guide to the framework's design philosophy.


1. While the `build` function returns a fresh tree,
    you only need to return something _different_ if
    there's some new configuration to incorporate.
    If the configuration is in fact the same,
    you can just return the same widget. [↩](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fnref-1)

2. This is a slight simplification for ease of reading.
    In practice, the tree might be more complex. [↩](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fnref-2)

3. There are some limitations with this approach, for example,
    transparency doesn't composite the same way for a platform view as
    it would for other Flutter widgets. [↩](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fnref-3)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Drag and drop is a common mobile app interaction.
As the user long presses (sometimes called _touch & hold_)
on a widget, another widget appears beneath the
user's finger, and the user drags the widget to a
final location and releases it.
In this recipe, you'll build a drag-and-drop interaction
where the user long presses on a choice of food,
and then drags that food to the picture of the customer who
is paying for it.


The following animation shows the app's behavior:

![Ordering the food by dragging it to the person](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/cookbook/effects/DragAUIElement.webp)

a drag-and-drop interaction. A `LongPressDraggable`
widget recognizes when a long press occurs and then
displays a new widget near the user's finger.
As the user drags, the widget follows the user's finger.
`LongPressDraggable` gives you full control over the
widget that the user drags.


Each menu list item is displayed with a custom
`MenuListItem` widget.


dart

```
MenuListItem(
  name: item.name,
  price: item.formattedTotalItemPrice,
  photoProvider: item.imageProvider,
)
```

content\_copy

Wrap the `MenuListItem` widget with a `LongPressDraggable` widget.

dart

```
LongPressDraggable<Item>(
  data: item,
  dragAnchorStrategy: pointerDragAnchorStrategy,
  feedback: DraggingListItem(
    dragKey: _draggableKey,
    photoProvider: item.imageProvider,
  ),
  child: MenuListItem(
    name: item.name,
    price: item.formattedTotalItemPrice,
    photoProvider: item.imageProvider,
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

In this case, when the user long presses on the
`MenuListItem` widget, the `LongPressDraggable`
widget displays a `DraggingListItem`.
This `DraggingListItem` displays a photo of the
selected food item, centered beneath
the user's finger.


The `dragAnchorStrategy` property is set to
[`pointerDragAnchorStrategy`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/pointerDragAnchorStrategy.html).
This property value instructs `LongPressDraggable`
to base the `DraggableListItem`'s position on the
user's finger. As the user moves a finger,
the `DraggableListItem` moves with it.


Dragging and dropping is of little use if no information
is transmitted when the item is dropped.
For this reason, `LongPressDraggable` takes a `data` parameter.
In this case, the type of `data` is `Item`,
which holds information about the
food menu item that the user pressed on.


The `data` associated with a `LongPressDraggable`
is sent to a special widget called `DragTarget`,
where the user releases the drag gesture.
You'll implement the drop behavior next.


## Drop the draggable

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/drag-a-widget#drop-the-draggable)

The user can drop a `LongPressDraggable` wherever they choose,
but dropping the draggable has no effect unless it's dropped
on top of a `DragTarget`. When the user drops a draggable on
top of a `DragTarget` widget, the `DragTarget` widget
can either accept or reject the data from the draggable.


In this recipe, the user should drop a menu item on a
`CustomerCart` widget to add the menu item to the user's cart.


dart

```
CustomerCart(
  hasItems: customer.items.isNotEmpty,
  highlighted: candidateItems.isNotEmpty,
  customer: customer,
);
```

content\_copy

Wrap the `CustomerCart` widget with a `DragTarget` widget.

dart

```
DragTarget<Item>(
  builder: (context, candidateItems, rejectedItems) {
    return CustomerCart(
      hasItems: customer.items.isNotEmpty,
      highlighted: candidateItems.isNotEmpty,
      customer: customer,
    );
  },
  onAcceptWithDetails: (details) {
    _itemDroppedOnCustomerCart(item: details.data, customer: customer);
  },
)
```

content\_copy

The `DragTarget` displays your existing widget and
also coordinates with `LongPressDraggable` to recognize
when the user drags a draggable on top of the `DragTarget`.
The `DragTarget` also recognizes when the user drops
a draggable on top of the `DragTarget` widget.


When the user drags a draggable on the `DragTarget` widget,
`candidateItems` contains the data items that the user is dragging.
This draggable allows you to change what your widget looks
like when the user is dragging over it. In this case,
the `Customer` widget turns red whenever any items are dragged above the
`DragTarget` widget. The red visual appearance is configured with the
`highlighted` property within the `CustomerCart` widget.


When the user drops a draggable on the `DragTarget` widget,
the `onAcceptWithDetails` callback is invoked. This is when you get
to decide whether or not to accept the data that was dropped.
In this case, the item is always accepted and processed.
You might choose to inspect the incoming item to make a
different decision.


Notice that the type of item dropped on `DragTarget`
must match the type of the item dragged from `LongPressDraggable`.
If the types are not compatible, then
the `onAcceptWithDetails` method isn't invoked.


With a `DragTarget` widget configured to accept your
desired data, you can now transmit data from one part
of your UI to another by dragging and dropping.


In the next step,
you update the customer's cart with the dropped menu item.


## Add a menu item to a cart

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/drag-a-widget#add-a-menu-item-to-a-cart)

Each customer is represented by a `Customer` object,
which maintains a cart of items and a price total.


dart

```
class Customer {
  Customer({required this.name, required this.imageProvider, List<Item>? items})
    : items = items ?? [];
​
  final String name;
  final ImageProvider imageProvider;
  final List<Item> items;
​
  String get formattedTotalItemPrice {
    final totalPriceCents = items.fold<int>(
      0,
      (prev, item) => prev + item.totalPriceCents,
    );
    return '\$${(totalPriceCents / 100.0).toStringAsFixed(2)}';
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The `CustomerCart` widget displays the customer's photo,
name, total, and item count based on a `Customer` instance.


To update a customer's cart when a menu item is dropped,
add the dropped item to the associated `Customer` object.


dart

```
void _itemDroppedOnCustomerCart({
  required Item item,
  required Customer customer,
}) {
  setState(() {
    customer.items.add(item);
  });
}
```

content\_copy

The `_itemDroppedOnCustomerCart` method is invoked in
`onAcceptWithDetails()` when the user drops a menu item on a
`CustomerCart` widget. By adding the dropped item to the
`customer` object, and invoking `setState()` to cause a
layout update, the UI refreshes with the new customer's
price total and item count.


Congratulations! You have a drag-and-drop interaction
that adds food items to a customer's shopping cart.


## Interactive example

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/drag-a-widget#interactive-example)

Run the app:

- Scroll through the food items.
- Press and hold on one with your
finger or click and hold with the
mouse.

- While holding, the food item's image
will appear above the list.

- Drag the image and drop it on one of the
people at the bottom of the screen.
The text under the image updates to
reflect the charge for that person.
You can continue to add food items
and watch the charges accumulate.

[vertical\_align\_topSwift Package Manager for plugin authors](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Flutter's Swift Package Manager integration has several benefits:

1. **Provides access to the Swift package ecosystem**.
    Flutter plugins can use the growing ecosystem of [Swift packages](https://swiftpackageindex.com/)!

2. **Simplifies Flutter installation**.
    Swift Package Manager is bundled with Xcode.
    In the future, you won’t need to install Ruby and CocoaPods to target iOS or
    macOS.


## How to turn on Swift Package Manager

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#how-to-turn-on-swift-package-manager)

Flutter's Swift Package Manager support is turned off by default.
To turn it on:


1. Upgrade to the latest Flutter SDK:



sh

```
flutter upgrade
```

content\_copy

2. Turn on the Swift Package Manager feature:



sh

```
flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
```

content\_copy


Using the Flutter CLI to run an app [migrates the project](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers/#how-to-add-swift-package-manager-integration)
to add
Swift Package Manager integration.
This makes your project download the Swift packages that
your Flutter plugins depend on.
An app with Swift Package Manager integration requires Flutter version 3.24 or
higher.
To use an older Flutter version,
you will need to [remove Swift Package Manager integration](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-remove-swift-package-manager-integration)

from the app.


Flutter falls back to CocoaPods for dependencies that do not support Swift
Package Manager yet.


## How to turn off Swift Package Manager

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#how-to-turn-off-swift-package-manager)

Disabling Swift Package Manager causes Flutter to use CocoaPods for all
dependencies.
However, Swift Package Manager remains integrated with your project.
To remove Swift Package Manager integration completely from your project,
follow the [How to remove Swift Package Manager integration](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-remove-swift-package-manager-integration)

instructions.


### Turn off for a single project

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#turn-off-for-a-single-project)

In the project's `pubspec.yaml` file, under the `flutter` section,
set `enable-swift-package-manager` to `false` in the `config`
subsection.


pubspec.yaml

yaml

```
# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  config:
    enable-swift-package-manager: false
```

content\_copy

This turns off Swift Package Manager for all contributors to this project.

### Turn off globally for all projects

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#turn-off-globally-for-all-projects)

Run the following command:

sh

```
flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager
```

content\_copy

This turns off Swift Package Manager for the current user.

If a project is incompatible with Swift Package Manager, all contributors
need to run this command.


## How to add Swift Package Manager support to an existing Flutter plugin

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#how-to-add-swift-package-manager-support-to-an-existing-flutter-plugin)

This guide shows how to add Swift Package Manager support to a plugin that
already supports CocoaPods.
This ensures the plugin is usable by all Flutter projects.


Flutter plugins should support _both_ Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods until
further notice.


Swift Package Manager adoption will be gradual.
Plugins that don't support CocoaPods won't be usable by projects that haven't
migrated to Swift Package Manager yet.
Plugins that don't support Swift Package Manager can cause problems for projects
that have migrated.


- [Swift plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#14-tab-panel)
- [Objective-C plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#15-tab-panel)

Replace `plugin_name` throughout this guide with the name of your plugin.
The example below uses `ios`, replace `ios` with `macos`/`darwin`
as applicable.


01. [Turn on the Swift Package Manager feature](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#how-to-turn-on-swift-package-manager).

02. Start by creating a directory under the `ios`, `macos`, and/or `darwin`

     directories.
     Name this new directory the name of the platform package.



    - plugin\_name/

      - ios/

        - …
        - plugin\_name/

03. Within this new directory, create the following files/directories:


    - `Package.swift` (file)
    - `Sources` (directory)
    - `Sources/plugin_name` (directory)

Your plugin should look like:

    - plugin\_name/

      - ios/

        - …
        - plugin\_name/

          - Package.swift
          - Sources/

            - plugin\_name/

04. Use the following template in the `Package.swift` file:



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
    // swift-tools-version: 5.9
    // The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.
    ​
    import PackageDescription
    ​
    let package = Package(
        // TODO: Update your plugin name.
        name: "plugin_name",
        platforms: [\
            // TODO: Update the platforms your plugin supports.\
            // If your plugin only supports iOS, remove `.macOS(...)`.\
            // If your plugin only supports macOS, remove `.iOS(...)`.\
            .iOS("13.0"),\
            .macOS("10.15")\
        ],
        products: [\
            // TODO: Update your library and target names.\
            // If the plugin name contains "_", replace with "-" for the library name.\
            .library(name: "plugin-name", targets: ["plugin_name"])\
        ],
        dependencies: [],
        targets: [\
            .target(\
                // TODO: Update your target name.\
                name: "plugin_name",\
                dependencies: [],\
                resources: [\
                    // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest\
                    // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file\
                    // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.\
                    // For more information, see:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\
                    // .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),\
    ​\
                    // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to\
                    // the following instructions to add them:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package\
                ]\
            )\
        ]
    )
    ```

    content\_copy

05. Update the [supported platforms](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/supportedplatform)
     in your `Package.swift` file.



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
        platforms: [\
            // TODO: Update the platforms your plugin supports.\
            // If your plugin only supports iOS, remove `.macOS(...)`.\
            // If your plugin only supports macOS, remove `.iOS(...)`.\
            .iOS("13.0"),\
            .macOS("10.15")\
        ],
    ```

    content\_copy

06. Update the package, library, and target names in your `Package.swift` file.



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
    let package = Package(
        // TODO: Update your plugin name.
        name: "plugin_name",
        platforms: [\
            .iOS("13.0"),\
            .macOS("10.15")\
        ],
        products: [\
            // TODO: Update your library and target names.\
            // If the plugin name contains "_", replace with "-" for the library name\
            .library(name: "plugin-name", targets: ["plugin_name"])\
        ],
        dependencies: [],
        targets: [\
            .target(\
                // TODO: Update your target name.\
                name: "plugin_name",\
                dependencies: [],\
                resources: [\
                    // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest\
                    // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file\
                    // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.\
                    // For more information, see:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\
                    // .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),\
    ​\
                    // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to\
                    // the following instructions to add them:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package\
                ]\
            )\
        ]
    )
    ```

    content\_copy

07. If your plugin has a [`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files), move it to
     `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` and uncomment
     the resource in the `Package.swift` file.



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
                resources: [\
                    // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest\
                    // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file\
                    // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.\
                    // For more information, see:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\
                    .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),\
    ​\
                    // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to\
                    // the following instructions to add them:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package\
                ],
    ```

    content\_copy

08. Move any resource files from `ios/Assets` to
     `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name` (or a subdirectory).
     Add the resource files to your `Package.swift` file, if applicable.
     For more instructions, see
     [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package).

09. Move all files from `ios/Classes` to `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name`.

10. The `ios/Assets`, `ios/Resources`, and `ios/Classes` directories should now
     be empty and can be deleted.

11. If your plugin uses [Pigeon](https://pub.dev/packages/pigeon), update your Pigeon input file.



    pigeons/messages.dart



    dart

    ```
    kotlinOptions: KotlinOptions(),
    javaOut: 'android/app/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/Messages.java',
    javaOptions: JavaOptions(),
    swiftOut: 'ios/Classes/messages.g.swift',
    swiftOut: 'ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/messages.g.swift',
    swiftOptions: SwiftOptions(),
    ```

    content\_copy

12. Update your `Package.swift` file with any customizations you might need.
    1. Open the `ios/plugin_name/` directory in Xcode.

    2. In Xcode, open your `Package.swift` file.
        Verify Xcode doesn't produce any warnings or errors for this file.

    3. If your `ios/plugin_name.podspec` file has [CocoaPods `dependency`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#dependency) s,
        add the corresponding [Swift Package Manager dependencies](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/package/dependency)
        to your
        `Package.swift` file.

    4. If your package must be linked explicitly `static` or `dynamic`
        ( [not recommended by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/product/library(name:type:targets:))), update the
        [Product](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/product) to define the
        type:



       Package.swift



       swift

       ```
       products: [\
           .library(name: "plugin-name", type: .static, targets: ["plugin_name"])\
       ],
       ```

       content\_copy

    5. Make any other customizations. For more information on how to write a
        `Package.swift` file, see
        [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription).
13. Update your `ios/plugin_name.podspec` to point to new paths.



    ios/plugin\_name.podspec



    ruby

    ```
    s.source_files = 'Classes/**/*.swift'
    s.resource_bundles = {'plugin_name_privacy' => ['Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy']}
    s.source_files = 'plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/**/*.swift'
    s.resource_bundles = {'plugin_name_privacy' => ['plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy']}
    ```

    content\_copy

14. Update loading of resources from bundle to use [`Bundle.module`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package#Access-a-resource-in-code).



    swift

    ```
    #if SWIFT_PACKAGE
         let settingsURL = Bundle.module.url(forResource: "image", withExtension: "jpg")
    #else
         let settingsURL = Bundle(for: Self.self).url(forResource: "image", withExtension: "jpg")
    #endif
    ```

    content\_copy

15. If your `.gitignore` doesn't include `.build/` and `.swiftpm/` directories,
     you'll want to update your `.gitignore` to include:



    .gitignore





    ```
    .build/
    .swiftpm/
    ```

    content\_copy



     Commit your plugin's changes to your version control system.

16. Verify the plugin still works with CocoaPods.
    1. Turn off Swift Package Manager.



       sh

       ```
       flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager
       ```

       content\_copy

    2. Navigate to the plugin's example app.



       sh

       ```
       cd path/to/plugin/example/
       ```

       content\_copy

    3. Ensure the plugin's example app builds and runs.



       sh

       ```
       flutter run
       ```

       content\_copy

    4. Navigate to the plugin's top-level directory.



       sh

       ```
       cd path/to/plugin/
       ```

       content\_copy

    5. Run CocoaPods validation lints.



       sh

       ```
       pod lib lint ios/plugin_name.podspec  --configuration=Debug --skip-tests --use-modular-headers --use-libraries
       ```

       content\_copy





       sh

       ```
       pod lib lint ios/plugin_name.podspec  --configuration=Debug --skip-tests --use-modular-headers
       ```

       content\_copy
17. Verify the plugin works with Swift Package Manager.
    1. Turn on Swift Package Manager.



       sh

       ```
       flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
       ```

       content\_copy

    2. Navigate to the plugin's example app.



       sh

       ```
       cd path/to/plugin/example/
       ```

       content\_copy

    3. Ensure the plugin's example app builds and runs.



       sh

       ```
       flutter run
       ```

       content\_copy

    4. Open the plugin's example app in Xcode.
        Ensure that **Package Dependencies** shows in the left
        **Project Navigator**.
18. Verify tests pass.
    - **If your plugin has native unit tests (XCTest), make sure you also**
      **[update unit tests in the plugin's example app](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors/#how-to-update-unit-tests-in-a-plugins-example-app).**

    - Follow instructions for [testing plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/testing-plugins).

Replace `plugin_name` throughout this guide with the name of your plugin.
The example below uses `ios`, replace `ios` with `macos`/`darwin`
as applicable.


01. [Turn on the Swift Package Manager feature](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#how-to-turn-on-swift-package-manager).

02. Start by creating a directory under the `ios`, `macos`, and/or `darwin`

     directories.
     Name this new directory the name of the platform package.



    - plugin\_name/

      - ios/

        - …
        - plugin\_name/

03. Within this new directory, create the following files/directories:


    - `Package.swift` (file)
    - `Sources` (directory)
    - `Sources/plugin_name` (directory)
    - `Sources/plugin_name/include` (directory)
    - `Sources/plugin_name/include/plugin_name` (directory)
    - `Sources/plugin_name/include/plugin_name/.gitkeep`(file)
      - This file ensures the directory is committed.
         You can remove the `.gitkeep` file if other files are added to the
         directory.

Your plugin should look like:

    - plugin\_name/

      - ios/

        - …
        - plugin\_name/

          - Package.swift
          - Sources/plugin\_name/include/plugin\_name/

            - .gitkeep/

04. Use the following template in the `Package.swift` file:



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
    // swift-tools-version: 5.9
    // The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.
    ​
    import PackageDescription
    ​
    let package = Package(
        // TODO: Update your plugin name.
        name: "plugin_name",
        platforms: [\
            // TODO: Update the platforms your plugin supports.\
            // If your plugin only supports iOS, remove `.macOS(...)`.\
            // If your plugin only supports macOS, remove `.iOS(...)`.\
            .iOS("13.0"),\
            .macOS("10.15")\
        ],
        products: [\
            // TODO: Update your library and target names.\
            // If the plugin name contains "_", replace with "-" for the library name\
            .library(name: "plugin-name", targets: ["plugin_name"])\
        ],
        dependencies: [],
        targets: [\
            .target(\
                // TODO: Update your target name.\
                name: "plugin_name",\
                dependencies: [],\
                resources: [\
                    // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest\
                    // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file\
                    // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.\
                    // For more information, see:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\
                    // .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),\
    ​\
                    // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to\
                    // the following instructions to add them:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package\
                ],\
                cSettings: [\
                    // TODO: Update your plugin name.\
                    .headerSearchPath("include/plugin_name")\
                ]\
            )\
        ]
    )
    ```

    content\_copy

05. Update the [supported platforms](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/supportedplatform)
     in your `Package.swift` file.



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
        platforms: [\
            // TODO: Update the platforms your plugin supports.\
            // If your plugin only supports iOS, remove `.macOS(...)`.\
            // If your plugin only supports macOS, remove `.iOS(...)`.\
            .iOS("13.0"),\
            .macOS("10.15")\
        ],
    ```

    content\_copy

06. Update the package, library, and target names in your `Package.swift` file.



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
    let package = Package(
        // TODO: Update your plugin name.
        name: "plugin_name",
        platforms: [\
            .iOS("13.0"),\
            .macOS("10.15")\
        ],
        products: [\
            // TODO: Update your library and target names.\
            // If the plugin name contains "_", replace with "-" for the library name\
            .library(name: "plugin-name", targets: ["plugin_name"])\
        ],
        dependencies: [],
        targets: [\
            .target(\
                // TODO: Update your target name.\
                name: "plugin_name",\
                dependencies: [],\
                resources: [\
                    // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest\
                    // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file\
                    // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.\
                    // For more information, see:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\
                    // .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),\
    ​\
                    // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to\
                    // the following instructions to add them:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package\
                ],\
                cSettings: [\
                    // TODO: Update your plugin name.\
                    .headerSearchPath("include/plugin_name")\
                ]\
            )\
        ]
    )
    ```

    content\_copy

07. If your plugin has a [`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files), move it to
     `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` and uncomment
     the resource in the `Package.swift` file.



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
                resources: [\
                    // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest\
                    // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file\
                    // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.\
                    // For more information, see:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files\
                    .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),\
    ​\
                    // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to\
                    // the following instructions to add them:\
                    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package\
                ],
    ```

    content\_copy

08. Move any resource files from `ios/Assets` to
     `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name` (or a subdirectory).
     Add the resource files to your `Package.swift` file, if applicable.
     For more instructions, see
     [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package).

09. Move any public headers from `ios/Classes` to
     `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/include/plugin_name`.
    - If you're unsure which headers are public, check your `podspec` file's
       [`public_header_files`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#public_header_files)
       attribute.
       If this attribute isn't specified, all of your headers were public.
       You should consider whether you want all of your headers to be public.

    - The `pluginClass` defined in your `pubspec.yaml` file must be public and
       within this directory.
10. Handling `modulemap`.

    Skip this step if your plugin does not have a `modulemap`.

    If you're using a `modulemap` for CocoaPods to create a Test submodule,
     consider removing it for Swift Package Manager.
     Note that this makes all public headers available through the module.

    To remove the `modulemap` for Swift Package Manager but keep it for
     CocoaPods, exclude the `modulemap` and umbrella header in the plugin's
     `Package.swift` file.

    The example below assumes the `modulemap` and umbrella header are located
     in the `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/include` directory.



    Package.swift



    swift

    ```
    .target(
        name: "plugin_name",
        dependencies: [],
        exclude: ["include/cocoapods_plugin_name.modulemap", "include/plugin_name-umbrella.h"],
    ```

    content\_copy



     If you want to keep your unit tests compatible with both CocoaPods and
     Swift Package Manager, you can try the following:



    Tests/TestFile.m



    objc

    ```
    @import plugin_name;
    @import plugin_name.Test;
    #if __has_include(<plugin_name/plugin_name-umbrella.h>)
      @import plugin_name.Test;
    #endif
    ```

    content\_copy



     If you would like to use a custom `modulemap` with your Swift package,
     refer to [Swift Package Manager's documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/Usage.md#creating-c-language-targets).

11. Move all remaining files from `ios/Classes` to
     `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name`.

12. The `ios/Assets`, `ios/Resources`, and `ios/Classes` directories should now
     be empty and can be deleted.

13. If your header files are no longer in the same directory as your
     implementation files, you should update your import statements.

    For example, imagine the following migration:


    - Before:





      ```
      ios/Classes/
      ├── PublicHeaderFile.h
      └── ImplementationFile.m
      ```

      content\_copy

    - After:





      ```
      ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/
      └── include/plugin_name/
         └── PublicHeaderFile.h
      └── ImplementationFile.m
      ```

      content\_copy


In this example, the import statements in `ImplementationFile.m`
should be updated:

Sources/plugin\_name/ImplementationFile.m

objc

```
#import "PublicHeaderFile.h"
#import "./include/plugin_name/PublicHeaderFile.h"
```

content\_copy

14. If your plugin uses [Pigeon](https://pub.dev/packages/pigeon), update your Pigeon input file.



    pigeons/messages.dart



    dart

    ```
    javaOptions: JavaOptions(),
    objcHeaderOut: 'ios/Classes/messages.g.h',
    objcSourceOut: 'ios/Classes/messages.g.m',
    objcHeaderOut: 'ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/messages.g.h',
    objcSourceOut: 'ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/messages.g.m',
    copyrightHeader: 'pigeons/copyright.txt',
    ```

    content\_copy



    If your `objcHeaderOut` file is no longer within the same directory as the
     `objcSourceOut`, you can change the `#import` using
     `ObjcOptions.headerIncludePath`:



    pigeons/messages.dart



    dart

    ```
    javaOptions: JavaOptions(),
    objcHeaderOut: 'ios/Classes/messages.g.h',
    objcSourceOut: 'ios/Classes/messages.g.m',
    objcHeaderOut: 'ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/include/plugin_name/messages.g.h',
    objcSourceOut: 'ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/messages.g.m',
    objcOptions: ObjcOptions(
      headerIncludePath: './include/plugin_name/messages.g.h',
    ),
    copyrightHeader: 'pigeons/copyright.txt',
    ```

    content\_copy



    Run Pigeon to re-generate its code with the latest configuration.

15. Update your `Package.swift` file with any customizations you might need.
    1. Open the `ios/plugin_name/` directory in Xcode.

    2. In Xcode, open your `Package.swift` file.
        Verify Xcode doesn't produce any warnings or errors for this file.

    3. If your `ios/plugin_name.podspec` file has [CocoaPods `dependency`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#dependency) s,
        add the corresponding [Swift Package Manager dependencies](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/package/dependency)
        to your
        `Package.swift` file.

    4. If your package must be linked explicitly `static` or `dynamic`
        ( [not recommended by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/product/library(name:type:targets:))), update the
        [Product](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/product) to define the
        type:



       Package.swift



       swift

       ```
       products: [\
           .library(name: "plugin-name", type: .static, targets: ["plugin_name"])\
       ],
       ```

       content\_copy

    5. Make any other customizations. For more information on how to write a
        `Package.swift` file, see
        [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription).
16. Update your `ios/plugin_name.podspec` to point to new paths.



    ios/plugin\_name.podspec



    ruby

    ```
    s.source_files = 'Classes/**/*.{h,m}'
    s.public_header_files = 'Classes/**/*.h'
    s.module_map = 'Classes/cocoapods_plugin_name.modulemap'
    s.resource_bundles = {'plugin_name_privacy' => ['Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy']}
    s.source_files = 'plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/**/*.{h,m}'
    s.public_header_files = 'plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/include/**/*.h'
    s.module_map = 'plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/include/cocoapods_plugin_name.modulemap'
    s.resource_bundles = {'plugin_name_privacy' => ['plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy']}
    ```

    content\_copy

17. Update loading of resources from bundle to use `SWIFTPM_MODULE_BUNDLE`:



    objc

    ```
    #if SWIFT_PACKAGE
       NSBundle *bundle = SWIFTPM_MODULE_BUNDLE;
     #else
       NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]];
     #endif
     NSURL *imageURL = [bundle URLForResource:@"image" withExtension:@"jpg"];
    ```

    content\_copy

18. If your `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/include` directory only
     contains a `.gitkeep`, you'll want update your `.gitignore`
     to include the
     following:



    .gitignore





    ```
    !.gitkeep
    ```

    content\_copy



     Run `flutter pub publish --dry-run` to ensure the `include` directory
     is published.

19. Commit your plugin's changes to your version control system.

20. Verify the plugin still works with CocoaPods.
    1. Turn off Swift Package Manager:



       sh

       ```
       flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager
       ```

       content\_copy

    2. Navigate to the plugin's example app.



       sh

       ```
       cd path/to/plugin/example/
       ```

       content\_copy

    3. Ensure the plugin's example app builds and runs.



       sh

       ```
       flutter run
       ```

       content\_copy

    4. Navigate to the plugin's top-level directory.



       sh

       ```
       cd path/to/plugin/
       ```

       content\_copy

    5. Run CocoaPods validation lints:



       sh

       ```
       pod lib lint ios/plugin_name.podspec  --configuration=Debug --skip-tests --use-modular-headers --use-libraries
       ```

       content\_copy





       sh

       ```
       pod lib lint ios/plugin_name.podspec  --configuration=Debug --skip-tests --use-modular-headers
       ```

       content\_copy
21. Verify the plugin works with Swift Package Manager.
    1. Turn on Swift Package Manager:



       sh

       ```
       flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
       ```

       content\_copy

    2. Navigate to the plugin's example app.



       sh

       ```
       cd path/to/plugin/example/
       ```

       content\_copy

    3. Ensure the plugin's example app builds and runs.



       sh

       ```
       flutter run
       ```

       content\_copy

    4. Open the plugin's example app in Xcode.
        Ensure that **Package Dependencies** shows in the left
        **Project Navigator**.
22. Verify tests pass.
    - **If your plugin has native unit tests (XCTest), make sure you also**
      **[update unit tests in the plugin's example app](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors/#how-to-update-unit-tests-in-a-plugins-example-app).**

    - Follow instructions for [testing plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/testing-plugins).

## How to update unit tests in a plugin's example app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-plugin-authors#how-to-update-unit-tests-in-a-plugins-example-app)

If your plugin has native XCTests, you might need to update them to work with
Swift Package Manager if one of the following is true:


- You're using a CocoaPod dependency for the test.
- Your plugin is explicitly set to `type: .dynamic` in its `Package.swift` file.

To update your unit tests:

1. Open your `example/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

2. If you were using a CocoaPod dependency for tests, such as `OCMock`,
    you'll want to remove it from your `Podfile` file.



ios/Podfile



ruby

```
target 'RunnerTests' do
     inherit! :search_paths
​
     pod 'OCMock', '3.5'
end
```

content\_copy



Then in the terminal, run `pod install` in the `plugin_name_ios/example/ios`
    directory.

3. Navigate to **Package Dependencies** for the project.
![The project's package dependencies](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/package-dependencies.png)

The project's package dependencies

4. Click the **+** button and add any test-only dependencies by searching for
    them in the top right search bar.
![Search for test-only dependencies](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/search-for-ocmock.png)

Search for test-only dependencies

5. Ensure the dependency is added to the `RunnerTests` Target.
![Ensure the dependency is added to the `RunnerTests` target](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/choose-package-products-test.png)

Ensure the dependency is added to the `RunnerTests` target

6. Click the **Add Package** button.

7. If you've explicitly set your plugin's library type to `.dynamic` in its
    `Package.swift` file
    ( [not recommended by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/product/library(name:type:targets:))),
    you'll also need to add it as a dependency to the `RunnerTests` target.
1. Ensure `RunnerTests` **Build Phases** has a **Link Binary With Libraries**

       build phase:
      ![The `Link Binary With Libraries` Build Phase in the `RunnerTests` target](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/runner-tests-link-binary-with-libraries.png)

      The `Link Binary With Libraries` Build Phase in the `RunnerTests` target


      If the build phase doesn't exist already, create one.
       Click the add
       button and
       then click **New Link Binary With Libraries Phase**.
      ![Add `Link Binary With Libraries` Build Phase](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/add-runner-tests-link-binary-with-libraries.png)

      Add `Link Binary With Libraries` Build Phase

2. Navigate to **Package Dependencies** for the project.

3. Click the add button.

4. In the dialog that opens, click the **Add Local...** button.

5. Navigate to `plugin_name/plugin_name_ios/ios/plugin_name_ios` and click
       the **Add Package** button.

6. Ensure that it's added to the `RunnerTests` target and click the
       **Add Package** button.
8. Ensure tests pass **Product > Test**.

Flutter's Swift Package Manager integration has several benefits:

1. **Provides access to the Swift package ecosystem**.
    Flutter plugins can use the growing ecosystem of [Swift packages](https://swiftpackageindex.com/).

2. **Simplifies Flutter installation**.
    Xcode includes Swift Package Manager.
    You don't need to install Ruby and CocoaPods if your project uses
    Swift Package Manager.


## How to turn on Swift Package Manager

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-turn-on-swift-package-manager)

Flutter's Swift Package Manager support is turned off by default.
To turn it on:


1. Upgrade to the latest Flutter SDK:



sh

```
flutter upgrade
```

content\_copy

2. Turn on the Swift Package Manager feature:



sh

```
flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
```

content\_copy


Using the Flutter CLI to run an app [migrates the project](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers/#how-to-add-swift-package-manager-integration)
to add
Swift Package Manager integration.
This makes your project download the Swift packages that
your Flutter plugins depend on.
An app with Swift Package Manager integration requires Flutter version 3.24 or
higher.
To use an older Flutter version,
you will need to [remove Swift Package Manager integration](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-remove-swift-package-manager-integration)

from the app.


Flutter falls back to CocoaPods for dependencies that do not support Swift
Package Manager yet.


## How to turn off Swift Package Manager

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-turn-off-swift-package-manager)

Disabling Swift Package Manager causes Flutter to use CocoaPods for all
dependencies.
However, Swift Package Manager remains integrated with your project.
To remove Swift Package Manager integration completely from your project,
follow the [How to remove Swift Package Manager integration](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-remove-swift-package-manager-integration)

instructions.


### Turn off for a single project

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#turn-off-for-a-single-project)

In the project's `pubspec.yaml` file, under the `flutter` section,
set `enable-swift-package-manager` to `false` in the `config`
subsection.


pubspec.yaml

yaml

```
# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  config:
    enable-swift-package-manager: false
```

content\_copy

This turns off Swift Package Manager for all contributors to this project.

### Turn off globally for all projects

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#turn-off-globally-for-all-projects)

Run the following command:

sh

```
flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager
```

content\_copy

This turns off Swift Package Manager for the current user.

If a project is incompatible with Swift Package Manager, all contributors
need to run this command.


## How to add Swift Package Manager integration

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-add-swift-package-manager-integration)

### Add to a Flutter app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#add-to-a-flutter-app)

- [iOS project](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#10-tab-panel)
- [macOS project](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#11-tab-panel)

Once you [turn on Swift Package Manager](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers/#how-to-turn-on-swift-package-manager), the Flutter CLI tries to migrate
your project the next time you run your app using the CLI.
This migration updates your Xcode project to use Swift Package Manager to
add Flutter plugin dependencies.


To migrate your project:

1. [Turn on Swift Package Manager](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers/#how-to-turn-on-swift-package-manager).

2. Run the iOS app using the Flutter CLI.

If your iOS project doesn't have Swift Package Manager integration yet, the
    Flutter CLI tries to migrate your project and outputs something like:





```
$ flutter run
Adding Swift Package Manager integration...
```

content\_copy



The automatic iOS migration modifies the
    `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` and
    `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/Runner.xcscheme`
    files.

3. If the Flutter CLI's automatic migration fails, follow the steps in
    [add Swift Package Manager integration manually](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers/#add-to-a-flutter-app-manually).


\[Optional\] To check if your project is migrated:

1. Run the app in Xcode.

2. Ensure that **Run Prepare Flutter Framework Script** runs as a pre-action
    and that `FlutterGeneratedPluginSwiftPackage` is a target dependency.

## How to use a Swift Package Manager Flutter plugin that requires a higher OS version

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/for-app-developers#how-to-use-a-swift-package-manager-flutter-plugin-that-requires-a-higher-os-version)

If a Swift Package Flutter Manager plugin requires a higher OS version than
the project, you might get an error like this:


```
Target Integrity (Xcode): The package product 'plugin_name_ios' requires minimum platform version 14.0 for the iOS platform, but this target supports 12.0
```

content\_copy

To use the plugin:

1. Open your app (`ios/Runner.xcworkspace` or `macos/Runner.xcworkspace`) in
    Xcode.

2. Increase your app's target **Minimum Deployments**.
![The target's **Minimum Deployments** setting](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/swift-package-manager/minimum-deployments.png)

_This introduction describes the conceptual difference between the_
_declarative style used by Flutter, and the imperative style used by_
_many other UI frameworks._

## Why a declarative UI?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/flutter-for/declarative#why-a-declarative-ui)

Frameworks from Win32 to web to Android and iOS typically use an imperative
style of UI programming. This might be the style you're most familiar
with—where you manually construct a full-functioned UI entity,
such as a UIView or equivalent, and later mutate it using methods and
setters when the UI changes.


In order to lighten the burden on developers from having to program how to
transition between various UI states, Flutter, by contrast,
lets the developer describe the current UI state and leaves the
transitioning to the framework.


This, however, requires a slight shift in thinking for how to manipulate UI.

## How to change UI in a declarative framework

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/flutter-for/declarative#how-to-change-ui-in-a-declarative-framework)

Consider a simplified example below:

![View B (contained by view A) morphs from containing two views, c1 and c2, to containing only view c3.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/declarativeUIchanges.png)

In the imperative style, you would typically go to ViewB's owner
and retrieve the instance `b` using selectors or with `findViewById`
or similar,
and invoke mutations on it (and implicitly invalidate it). For example:


java

```
// Imperative style
b.setColor(red)
b.clearChildren()
ViewC c3 = new ViewC(...)
b.add(c3)
```

content\_copy

You might also need to replicate this configuration in the constructor of
ViewB since the source of truth for the UI might outlive instance `b` itself.


In the declarative style, view configurations (such as Flutter's Widgets)
are immutable and are only lightweight "blueprints". To change the UI,
a widget triggers a rebuild on itself (most commonly by calling `setState()`

on StatefulWidgets in Flutter) and constructs a new Widget subtree.


dart

```
// Declarative style
return ViewB(color: red, child: const ViewC());
```

content\_copy

Here, rather than mutating an old instance `b` when the UI changes,
Flutter constructs new Widget instances. The framework manages many of the
responsibilities of a traditional UI object (such as maintaining the
state of the layout) behind the scenes with RenderObjects.
RenderObjects persist between frames and Flutter's lightweight Widgets
tell the framework to mutate the RenderObjects between states.
The Flutter framework handles the rest.

[vertical\_align\_topUnderstanding Flutter's keyboard focus system](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This article explains how to control where keyboard input is directed. If you
are implementing an application that uses a physical keyboard, such as most
desktop and web applications, this page is for you. If your app won't be used
with a physical keyboard, you can skip this.


## Overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#overview)

Flutter comes with a focus system that directs the keyboard input to a
particular part of an application. In order to do this, users "focus" the input
onto that part of an application by tapping or clicking the desired UI element.
Once that happens, text entered with the keyboard flows to that part of the
application until the focus moves to another part of the application. Focus can
also be moved by pressing a particular keyboard shortcut, which is typically
bound to `Tab`, so it is sometimes called "tab traversal".


This page explores the APIs used to perform these operations on a Flutter
application, and how the focus system works. We have noticed that there is some
confusion among developers about how to define and use [`FocusNode`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusNode-class.html)
objects.
If that describes your experience, skip ahead to the [best practices for\\
creating `FocusNode` objects](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#best-practices-for-creating-focusnode-objects).


### Focus use cases

system:

## Glossary

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#glossary)

Below are terms, as Flutter uses them, for elements of the focus system. The
various classes that implement some of these concepts are introduced below.


- **Focus tree** \- A tree of focus nodes that typically sparsely mirrors the
widget tree, representing all the widgets that can receive focus.

- **Focus node** \- A single node in a focus tree. This node can receive the
focus, and is said to "have focus" when it is part of the focus chain. It
participates in handling key events only when it has focus.

- **Primary focus** \- The farthest focus node from the root of the focus tree
that has focus. This is the focus node where key events start propagating to
the primary focus node and its ancestors.

- **Focus chain** \- An ordered list of focus nodes that starts at the primary
focus node and follows the branches of the focus tree to the root of the
focus tree.

- **Focus scope** \- A special focus node whose job is to contain a group of
other focus nodes, and allow only those nodes to receive focus. It contains
information about which nodes were previously focused in its subtree.

- **Focus traversal** \- The process of moving from one focusable node to
another in a predictable order. This is typically seen in applications when
the user presses `Tab` to move to the next focusable control or
field.


## FocusNode and FocusScopeNode

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#focusnode-and-focusscopenode)

The `FocusNode` and [`FocusScopeNode`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusScopeNode-class.html)
objects implement the
mechanics of the focus system. They are long-lived objects (longer than widgets,
similar to render objects) that hold the focus state and attributes so that they
are persistent between builds of the widget tree. Together, they form
the focus tree data structure.


They were originally intended to be developer-facing objects used to control
some aspects of the focus system, but over time they have evolved to mostly
implement details of the focus system. In order to prevent breaking existing
applications, they still contain public interfaces for their attributes. But, in
general, the thing for which they are most useful is to act as a relatively
opaque handle, passed to a descendant widget in order to call `requestFocus()`

on an ancestor widget, which requests that a descendant widget obtain focus.
Setting of the other attributes is best managed by a [`Focus`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Focus-class.html)
or
[`FocusScope`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusScope-class.html)
widget, unless you are not using them, or implementing your own
version of them.


### Best practices for creating FocusNode objects

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#best-practices-for-creating-focusnode-objects)

Some dos and don'ts around using these objects include:

- Don't allocate a new `FocusNode` for each build. This can cause
memory leaks, and occasionally causes a loss of focus when the widget
rebuilds while the node has focus.

- Do create `FocusNode` and `FocusScopeNode` objects in a stateful widget.
`FocusNode` and `FocusScopeNode` need to be disposed of when you're done
using them, so they should only be created inside of a stateful widget's
state object, where you can override `dispose` to dispose of them.

- Don't use the same `FocusNode` for multiple widgets. If you do, the
widgets will fight over managing the attributes of the node, and you
probably won't get what you expect.

- Do set the `debugLabel` of a focus node widget to help with diagnosing
focus issues.

- Don't set the `onKeyEvent` callback on a `FocusNode` or `FocusScopeNode`
if
they are being managed by a `Focus` or `FocusScope` widget.
If you want an `onKeyEvent` handler, then add a new `Focus`
widget
around the widget subtree you would like to listen to, and
set the `onKeyEvent` attribute of the widget to your handler.
Set `canRequestFocus: false` on the widget if
you also don't want it to be able to take primary focus.
This is because the `onKeyEvent` attribute on the `Focus` widget can be
set to something else in a subsequent build, and if that happens,
it overwrites the `onKeyEvent` handler you set on the node.

- Do call `requestFocus()` on a node to request that it receives the
primary focus, especially from an ancestor that has passed a node it owns to
a descendant where you want to focus.

- Do use `focusNode.requestFocus()`. It is not necessary to call
`FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(focusNode)`. The
`focusNode.requestFocus()` method is equivalent and more performant.


### Unfocusing

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#unfocusing)

There is an API for telling a node to "give up the focus", named
`FocusNode.unfocus()`. While it does remove focus from the node, it is important
to realize that there really is no such thing as "unfocusing" all nodes. If a
node is unfocused, then it must pass the focus somewhere else, since there is
_always_ a primary focus. The node that receives the focus when a node calls
`unfocus()` is either the nearest `FocusScopeNode`, or a previously focused node
in that scope, depending upon the `disposition` argument given to `unfocus()`.
If you would like more control over where the focus goes when you remove it from
a node, explicitly focus another node instead of calling `unfocus()`, or use the
focus traversal mechanism to find another node with the `focusInDirection`,
`nextFocus`, or `previousFocus` methods on `FocusNode`.


When calling `unfocus()`, the `disposition` argument allows two modes for
unfocusing: [`UnfocusDisposition.scope`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/UnfocusDisposition.html)
and
`UnfocusDisposition.previouslyFocusedChild`. The default is `scope`, which gives
the focus to the nearest parent focus scope. This means that if the focus is
thereafter moved to the next node with `FocusNode.nextFocus`, it starts with the
"first" focusable item in the scope.


The `previouslyFocusedChild` disposition will search the scope to find the
previously focused child and request focus on it. If there is no previously
focused child, it is equivalent to `scope`.


## Focus widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#focus-widget)

The `Focus` widget owns and manages a focus node, and is the workhorse of the
focus system. It manages the attaching and detaching of the focus node it owns
from the focus tree, manages the attributes and callbacks of the focus node, and
has static functions to enable discovery of focus nodes attached to the widget
tree.


In its simplest form, wrapping the `Focus` widget around a widget subtree allows
that widget subtree to obtain focus as part of the focus traversal process, or
whenever `requestFocus` is called on the `FocusNode` passed to it. When combined
with a gesture detector that calls `requestFocus`, it can receive focus when
tapped or clicked.


You might pass a `FocusNode` object to the `Focus` widget to manage, but if you
don't, it creates its own. The main reason to create your own
`FocusNode` is to be able to call `requestFocus()`
on the node to control the focus from a parent widget. Most of the other
functionality of a `FocusNode` is best accessed by changing the attributes of
the `Focus` widget itself.


The `Focus` widget is used in most of Flutter's own controls to implement their
focus functionality.


Here is an example showing how to use the `Focus` widget to make a custom
control focusable. It creates a container with text that reacts to receiving the
focus.


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());
​
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
  static const String _title = 'Focus Sample';
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: _title,
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text(_title)),
        body: const Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[MyCustomWidget(), MyCustomWidget()],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
​
class MyCustomWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyCustomWidget({super.key});
​
  @override
  State<MyCustomWidget> createState() => _MyCustomWidgetState();
}
​
class _MyCustomWidgetState extends State<MyCustomWidget> {
  Color _color = Colors.white;
  String _label = 'Unfocused';
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Focus(
      onFocusChange: (focused) {
        setState(() {
          _color = focused ? Colors.black26 : Colors.white;
          _label = focused ? 'Focused' : 'Unfocused';
        });
      },
      child: Center(
        child: Container(
          width: 300,
          height: 50,
          alignment: Alignment.center,
          color: _color,
          child: Text(_label),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Key events

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#key-events)

If you wish to listen for key events in a subtree,
set the `onKeyEvent` attribute of the `Focus` widget to
be a handler that either just listens to the key, or
handles the key and stops its propagation to other widgets.


Key events start at the focus node with primary focus.
If that node doesn't return `KeyEventResult.handled` from
its `onKeyEvent` handler, then its parent focus node is given the event.
If the parent doesn't handle it, it goes to its parent,
and so on, until it reaches the root of the focus tree.
If the event reaches the root of the focus tree without being handled, then
it is returned to the platform to give to
the next native control in the application
(in case the Flutter UI is part of a larger native application UI).
Events that are handled are not propagated to other Flutter widgets,
and they are also not propagated to native widgets.


Here's an example of a `Focus` widget that absorbs every key that
its subtree doesn't handle, without being able to be the primary focus:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Focus(
    onKeyEvent: (node, event) => KeyEventResult.handled,
    canRequestFocus: false,
    child: child,
  );
}
```

content\_copy

Focus key events are processed before text entry events, so handling a key event
when the focus widget surrounds a text field prevents that key from being
entered into the text field.


Here's an example of a widget that won't allow the letter "a" to be typed into
the text field:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Focus(
    onKeyEvent: (node, event) {
      return (event.logicalKey == LogicalKeyboardKey.keyA)
          ? KeyEventResult.handled
          : KeyEventResult.ignored;
    },
    child: const TextField(),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

If the intent is input validation, this example's functionality would probably
be better implemented using a `TextInputFormatter`, but the technique can still
be useful: the `Shortcuts` widget uses this method to handle shortcuts before
they become text input, for instance.


### Controlling what gets focus

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#controlling-what-gets-focus)

One of the main aspects of focus is controlling what can receive focus and how.
The attributes `canRequestFocus`, `skipTraversal,` and `descendantsAreFocusable`

control how this node and its descendants participate in the focus process.


If the `skipTraversal` attribute true, then this focus node doesn't participate
in focus traversal. It is still focusable if `requestFocus` is called on its
focus node, but is otherwise skipped when the focus traversal system is looking
for the next thing to focus on.


The `canRequestFocus` attribute, unsurprisingly, controls whether or not the
focus node that this `Focus` widget manages can be used to request focus. If
this attribute is false, then calling `requestFocus` on the node has no effect.
It also implies that this node is skipped for focus traversal, since it can't
request focus.


The `descendantsAreFocusable` attribute controls whether the descendants of this
node can receive focus, but still allows this node to receive focus. This
attribute can be used to turn off focusability for an entire widget subtree.
This is how the `ExcludeFocus` widget works: it's just a `Focus`
widget with
this attribute set.


### Autofocus

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#autofocus)

Setting the `autofocus` attribute of a `Focus` widget tells the widget to
request the focus the first time the focus scope it belongs to is focused. If
more than one widget has `autofocus` set, then it is arbitrary which one
receives the focus, so try to only set it on one widget per focus scope.


The `autofocus` attribute only takes effect if there isn't already a focus in
the scope that the node belongs to.


Setting the `autofocus` attribute on two nodes that belong to different focus
scopes is well defined: each one becomes the focused widget when their
corresponding scopes are focused.


### Change notifications

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#change-notifications)

The `Focus.onFocusChanged` callback can be used to get notifications that the
focus state for a particular node has changed. It notifies if the node is added
to or removed from the focus chain, which means it gets notifications even if it
isn't the primary focus. If you only want to know if you have received the
primary focus, check and see if `hasPrimaryFocus` is true on the focus node.


### Obtaining the FocusNode

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#obtaining-the-focusnode)

Sometimes, it is useful to obtain the focus node of a `Focus` widget to
interrogate its attributes.


To access the focus node from an ancestor of the `Focus` widget, create and pass
in a `FocusNode` as the `Focus` widget's `focusNode`
attribute. Because it needs
to be disposed of, the focus node you pass needs to be owned by a stateful
widget, so don't just create one each time it is built.


If you need access to the focus node from the descendant of a `Focus` widget,
you can call `Focus.of(context)` to obtain the focus node of the nearest
`Focus`widget to the given context. If you need to obtain the `FocusNode` of a
`Focus`
widget within the same build function, use a [`Builder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Builder-class.html)
to make sure you have
the correct context. This is shown in the following example:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Focus(
    child: Builder(
      builder: (context) {
        final bool hasPrimary = Focus.of(context).hasPrimaryFocus;
        print('Building with primary focus: $hasPrimary');
        return const SizedBox(width: 100, height: 100);
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

### Timing

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#timing)

One of the details of the focus system is that when focus is requested, it only
takes effect after the current build phase completes. This means that focus
changes are always delayed by one frame, because changing focus can
cause arbitrary parts of the widget tree to rebuild, including ancestors of the
widget currently requesting focus. Because descendants cannot dirty their
ancestors, it has to happen between frames, so that any needed changes can
happen on the next frame.


## FocusScope widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#focusscope-widget)

The `FocusScope` widget is a special version of the `Focus` widget that manages
a `FocusScopeNode` instead of a `FocusNode`. The `FocusScopeNode`
is a special
node in the focus tree that serves as a grouping mechanism for the focus nodes
in a subtree. Focus traversal stays within a focus scope unless a node outside
of the scope is explicitly focused.


The focus scope also keeps track of the current focus and history of the nodes
focused within its subtree. That way, if a node releases focus or is removed
when it had focus, the focus can be returned to the node that had focus
previously.


Focus scopes also serve as a place to return focus to if none of the descendants
have focus. This allows the focus traversal code to have a starting context for
finding the next (or first) focusable control to move to.


If you focus a focus scope node, it first attempts to focus the current, or most
recently focused node in its subtree, or the node in its subtree that requested
autofocus (if any). If there is no such node, it receives the focus itself.


## FocusableActionDetector widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#focusableactiondetector-widget)

The [`FocusableActionDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusableActionDetector-class.html)
is a widget that combines the functionality of
[`Actions`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Actions-class.html),
[`Shortcuts`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Shortcuts-class.html), [`MouseRegion`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MouseRegion-class.html)
and a `Focus` widget to create
a detector that defines actions and key bindings, and provides callbacks for
handling focus and hover highlights. It is what Flutter controls use to
implement all of these aspects of the controls. It is just implemented using the
constituent widgets, so if you don't need all of its functionality, you can just
use the ones you need, but it is a convenient way to build these behaviors into
your custom controls.


## Controlling focus traversal

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#controlling-focus-traversal)

Once an application has the ability to focus, the next thing many apps want to
do is to allow the user to control the focus using the keyboard or another input
device. The most common example of this is "tab traversal" where the user
presses `Tab` to go to the "next" control. Controlling what "next"
means is the subject of this section. This kind of traversal is provided by
Flutter by default.


In a simple grid layout, it's fairly easy to decide which control is next. If
you're not at the end of the row, then it's the one to the right (or left for
right-to-left locales). If you are at the end of a row, it's the first control
in the next row. Unfortunately, applications are rarely laid out in grids, so
more guidance is often needed.


The default algorithm in Flutter ( [`ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy-class.html)) for focus
traversal is pretty good: It gives the right answer for most applications.
However, there are always pathological cases, or cases where the context or
design requires a different order than the one the default ordering algorithm
arrives at. For those cases, there are other mechanisms for achieving the
desired order.


### FocusTraversalGroup widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#focustraversalgroup-widget)

The [`FocusTraversalGroup`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusTraversalGroup-class.html)
widget should be placed in the tree around widget
subtrees that should be fully traversed before moving on to another widget or
group of widgets. Just grouping widgets into related groups is often enough to
resolve many tab traversal ordering problems. If not, the group can also be
given a [`FocusTraversalPolicy`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusTraversalPolicy-class.html)
to determine the ordering within the group.


The default [`ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy-class.html)
is usually sufficient, but in
cases where more control over ordering is needed, an
[`OrderedTraversalPolicy`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/OrderedTraversalPolicy-class.html)
can be used. The `order` argument of the
[`FocusTraversalOrder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusTraversalOrder-class.html)
widget wrapped around the focusable components
determines the order. The order can be any subclass of [`FocusOrder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusOrder-class.html), but
[`NumericFocusOrder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/NumericFocusOrder-class.html)
and [`LexicalFocusOrder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LexicalFocusOrder-class.html)
are provided.


If none of the provided focus traversal policies are sufficient for your
application, you could also write your own policy and use it to determine any
custom ordering you want.


Here's an example of how to use the `FocusTraversalOrder` widget to traverse a
row of buttons in the order TWO, ONE, THREE using `NumericFocusOrder`.


dart

```
class OrderedButtonRow extends StatelessWidget {
  const OrderedButtonRow({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FocusTraversalGroup(
      policy: OrderedTraversalPolicy(),
      child: Row(
        children: <Widget>[\
          const Spacer(),\
          FocusTraversalOrder(\
            order: const NumericFocusOrder(2),\
            child: TextButton(child: const Text('ONE'), onPressed: () {}),\
          ),\
          const Spacer(),\
          FocusTraversalOrder(\
            order: const NumericFocusOrder(1),\
            child: TextButton(child: const Text('TWO'), onPressed: () {}),\
          ),\
          const Spacer(),\
          FocusTraversalOrder(\
            order: const NumericFocusOrder(3),\
            child: TextButton(child: const Text('THREE'), onPressed: () {}),\
          ),\
          const Spacer(),\
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### FocusTraversalPolicy

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#focustraversalpolicy)

The `FocusTraversalPolicy` is the object that determines which widget is next,
given a request and the current focus node. The requests (member functions) are
things like `findFirstFocus`, `findLastFocus`, `next`,
`previous`, and
`inDirection`.


`FocusTraversalPolicy` is the abstract base class for concrete policies, like
`ReadingOrderTraversalPolicy`, `OrderedTraversalPolicy` and the
[`DirectionalFocusTraversalPolicyMixin`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DirectionalFocusTraversalPolicyMixin-mixin.html)
classes.


In order to use a `FocusTraversalPolicy`, you give one to a
`FocusTraversalGroup`, which determines the widget subtree in which the policy
will be effective. The member functions of the class are rarely called directly:
they are meant to be used by the focus system.


## The focus manager

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/focus#the-focus-manager)

The [`FocusManager`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusManager-class.html)
maintains the current primary focus for the system. It
only has a few pieces of API that are useful to users of the focus system. One
is the `FocusManager.instance.primaryFocus` property, which contains the
currently focused focus node and is also accessible from the global
`primaryFocus` field.


Other useful properties are `FocusManager.instance.highlightMode` and
`FocusManager.instance.highlightStrategy`. These are used by widgets that need
to switch between a "touch" mode and a "traditional" (mouse and keyboard) mode
for their focus highlights. When a user is using touch to navigate, the focus
highlight is usually hidden, and when they switch to a mouse or keyboard, the
focus highlight needs to be shown again so they know what is focused. The
`hightlightStrategy` tells the focus manager how to interpret changes in the
usage mode of the device: it can either automatically switch between the two
based on the most recent input events, or it can be locked in touch or
traditional modes. The provided widgets in Flutter already know how to use this
information, so you only need it if you're writing your own controls from
scratch. You can use `addHighlightModeListener` callback to listen for changes
in the highlight mode.

## What is GenUI?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/genui#what-is-genui)

At its core, the GenUI SDK for Flutter is an orchestration layer.
This suite of packages coordinates the flow of information between your user,
your Flutter widgets, and an AI agent,
transforming text-based conversations into rich, interactive experiences.


Imagine that, instead of presenting your user with a wall of text,
they are presented with a graphical UI consisting of (for example),
a row of labeled buttons and a date picker.


The GenUI SDK for Flutter uses a JSON-based format to
compose a UI from your existing
widget catalog. As a user interacts with the UI,
state changes are fed back to the agent,
creating a high-bandwidth loop and turning
an agent interaction into a rich, intuitive experience.


The GenUI SDK for Flutter is designed to easily integrate
into your Flutter application.


## When would you use it?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/genui#when-would-you-use-it)

Use GenUI SDK for Flutter to incorporate graphical UI
into your app. For example:


- Instead of describing a list of products in text,
use it to render a clickable carousel of product widgets.

- When a user asks to plan a trip, use it to generate a
complete form with sliders, date pickers, and text fields.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

An offline-first application is an app capable of offering most
or all of its functionality while being disconnected from the internet.
Offline-first applications usually rely on stored data
to offer users temporary access to data
that would otherwise only be available online.


Some offline-first applications combine local and remote data seamlessly,
while other applications inform the user
when the application is using cached data.
In the same way,
some applications synchronize data in the background
while others require the user to explicitly synchronize it.
It all depends on the application requirements and the functionality it offers,
and it’s up to the developer to decide which implementation fits their needs.


In this guide,
you will learn how to implement different approaches
to offline-first applications in Flutter,
following the [Flutter Architecture guidelines](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture).


## Offline-first architecture

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#offline-first-architecture)

As explained in the common architecture concepts guide,
repositories act as the single source of truth.
They are responsible for presenting local or remote data,
and should be the only place where data can be modified.
In offline-first applications,
repositories combine different local and remote data sources
to present data in a single access point,
independently of the connectivity state of the device.


This example uses the `UserProfileRepository`,
a repository that allows you to obtain and store `UserProfile` objects
with offline-first support.


The `UserProfileRepository` uses two different data services:
one works with remote data,
and the other works with a local database.


The API client,`ApiClientService`,
connects to a remote service using HTTP REST calls.


dart

```
class ApiClientService {
  /// performs GET network request to obtain a UserProfile
  Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async {
    // ···
  }
​
  /// performs PUT network request to update a UserProfile
  Future<void> putUserProfile(UserProfile userProfile) async {
    // ···
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The database service, `DatabaseService`, stores data using SQL,
similar to the one found in the [Persistent Storage Architecture: SQL](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/sql)
recipe.


dart

```
class DatabaseService {
  /// Fetches the UserProfile from the database.
  /// Returns null if the user profile is not found.
  Future<UserProfile?> fetchUserProfile() async {
    // ···
  }
​
  /// Update UserProfile in the database.
  Future<void> updateUserProfile(UserProfile userProfile) async {
    // ···
  }
}
```

content\_copy

This example also uses the `UserProfile` data class
that has been created using the [`freezed`](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed)
package.


dart

```
@freezed
abstract class UserProfile with _$UserProfile {
  const factory UserProfile({
    required String name,
    required String photoUrl,
  }) = _UserProfile;
}
```

content\_copy

In apps that have complex data,
such as when the remote data contains more fields than the needed by the UI,
you might want to have one data class for the API and database services,
and another for the UI.
For example,
`UserProfileLocal` for the database entity,
`UserProfileRemote` for the API response object,
and then `UserProfile` for the UI data model class.
The `UserProfileRepository` would take care
of converting from one to the other when necessary.


This example also includes the `UserProfileViewModel`,
a view model that uses the `UserProfileRepository`
to display the `UserProfile` on a widget.


dart

```
class UserProfileViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  // ···
  final UserProfileRepository _userProfileRepository;
​
  UserProfile? get userProfile => _userProfile;
  // ···
​
  /// Load the user profile from the database or the network
  Future<void> load() async {
    // ···
  }
​
  /// Save the user profile with the new name
  Future<void> save(String newName) async {
    // ···
  }
}
```

content\_copy

## Reading data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#reading-data)

Reading data is a fundamental part of any application
that relies on remote API services.


In offline-first applications,
you want to ensure that the access to this data is as fast as possible,
and that it doesn’t depend on the device being online
to provide data to the user.
This is similar to the [Optimistic State design pattern](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/optimistic-state).


In this section,
you will learn two different approaches,
one that uses the database as a fallback,
and one that combines local and remote data using a `Stream`.


### Using local data as a fallback

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#using-local-data-as-a-fallback)

As a first approach,
you can implement offline support by having a fallback mechanism
for when the user is offline or a network call fails.


In this case, the `UserProfileRepository` attempts to obtain the `UserProfile`
from the remote API server using the `ApiClientService`.
If this request fails,
then returns the locally stored `UserProfile` from the `DatabaseService`.


dart

```
Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async {
  try {
    // Fetch the user profile from the API
    final apiUserProfile = await _apiClientService.getUserProfile();
    //Update the database with the API result
    await _databaseService.updateUserProfile(apiUserProfile);
​
    return apiUserProfile;
  } catch (e) {
    // If the network call failed,
    // fetch the user profile from the database
    final databaseUserProfile = await _databaseService.fetchUserProfile();
​
    // If the user profile was never fetched from the API
    // it will be null, so throw an  error
    if (databaseUserProfile != null) {
      return databaseUserProfile;
    } else {
      // Handle the error
      throw Exception('User profile not found');
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

### Using a Stream

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#using-a-stream)

A better alternative presents the data using a `Stream`.
In the best case scenario,
the `Stream` emits two values,
the locally stored data, and the data from the server.


First, the stream emits the locally stored data using the `DatabaseService`.
This call is generally faster and less error prone than a network call,
and by doing it first the view model can already display data to the user.


If the database does not contain any cached data,
then the `Stream` relies completely on the network call,
emitting only one value.


Then, the method performs the network call using the `ApiClientService`
to obtain up-to-date data.
If the request was successful,
it updates the database with the newly obtained data,
and then yields the value to the view model,
so it can be displayed to the user.


dart

```
Stream<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async* {
  // Fetch the user profile from the database
  final userProfile = await _databaseService.fetchUserProfile();
  // Returns the database result if it exists
  if (userProfile != null) {
    yield userProfile;
  }
​
  // Fetch the user profile from the API
  try {
    final apiUserProfile = await _apiClientService.getUserProfile();
    //Update the database with the API result
    await _databaseService.updateUserProfile(apiUserProfile);
    // Return the API result
    yield apiUserProfile;
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle the error
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The view model must subscribe
to this `Stream` and wait until it has completed.
For that, call `asFuture()` with the `Subscription` object and await the result.


For each obtained value,
update the view model data and call `notifyListeners()`
so the UI shows the latest data.


dart

```
Future<void> load() async {
  await _userProfileRepository
      .getUserProfile()
      .listen(
        (userProfile) {
          _userProfile = userProfile;
          notifyListeners();
        },
        onError: (error) {
          // handle error
        },
      )
      .asFuture<void>();
}
```

content\_copy

### Using only local data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#using-only-local-data)

Another possible approach uses locally stored data for read operations.
This approach requires that the data has been preloaded
at some point into the database,
and requires a synchronization mechanism that can keep the data up to date.


dart

```
Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async {
  // Fetch the user profile from the database
  final userProfile = await _databaseService.fetchUserProfile();
​
  // Return the database result if it exists
  if (userProfile == null) {
    throw Exception('Data not found');
  }
​
  return userProfile;
}
​
Future<void> sync() async {
  try {
    // Fetch the user profile from the API
    final userProfile = await _apiClientService.getUserProfile();
​
    // Update the database with the API result
    await _databaseService.updateUserProfile(userProfile);
  } catch (e) {
    // Try again later
  }
}
```

content\_copy

This approach can be useful for applications
that don’t require data to be in sync with the server at all times.
For example, a weather application
where the weather data is only updated once a day.


Synchronization could be done manually by the user,
for example, a pull-to-refresh action that then calls the `sync()` method,
or done periodically by a `Timer` or a background process.
You can learn how to implement a synchronization task
in the section about synchronizing state.


## Writing data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#writing-data)

Writing data in offline-first applications depends fundamentally
on the application use case.


Some applications might require the user input data
to be immediately available on the server side,
while other applications might be more flexible
and allow data to be out-of-sync temporarily.


This section explains two different approaches
for implementing writing data in offline-first applications.


### Online-only writing

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#online-only-writing)

One approach for writing data in offline-first applications
is to enforce being online to write data.
While this might sound counterintuitive,
this ensures that the data the user has modified
is fully synchronized with the server,
and the application doesn’t have a different state than the server.


In this case, you first attempt to send the data to the API service,
and if the request succeeds,
then store the data in the database.


dart

```
Future<void> updateUserProfile(UserProfile userProfile) async {
  try {
    // Update the API with the user profile
    await _apiClientService.putUserProfile(userProfile);
​
    // Only if the API call was successful
    // update the database with the user profile
    await _databaseService.updateUserProfile(userProfile);
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle the error
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The disadvantage in this case is that the offline-first functionality
is only available for read operations,
but not for write operations, as those require the user being online.


### Offline-first writing

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#offline-first-writing)

The second approach works the other way around.
Instead of performing the network call first,
the application first stores the new data in the database,
and then attempts to send it to the API service once it has been stored locally.


dart

```
Future<void> updateUserProfile(UserProfile userProfile) async {
  // Update the database with the user profile
  await _databaseService.updateUserProfile(userProfile);
​
  try {
    // Update the API with the user profile
    await _apiClientService.putUserProfile(userProfile);
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle the error
  }
}
```

content\_copy

This approach allows users to store data locally
even when the application is offline,
however, if the network call fails,
the local database and the API service are no longer in sync.
In the next section,
you will learn different approaches to handle synchronization
between local and remote data.


## Synchronizing state

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#synchronizing-state)

Keeping the local and remote data in sync
is an important part of offline-first applications,
as the changes that have been done locally
need to be copied to the remote service.
The app must also ensure that, when the user goes back to the application,
the locally stored data is the same as in the remote service.


### Writing a synchronization task

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#writing-a-synchronization-task)

There are different approaches for implementing
synchronization in a background task.


A simple solution is to create a `Timer`
in the `UserProfileRepository` that runs periodically,
for example every five minutes.


dart

```
Timer.periodic(const Duration(minutes: 5), (timer) => sync());
```

content\_copy

The `sync()` method then fetches the `UserProfile` from the database,
and if it requires synchronization, it is then sent to the API service.


dart

```
Future<void> sync() async {
  try {
    // Fetch the user profile from the database
    final userProfile = await _databaseService.fetchUserProfile();
​
    // Check if the user profile requires synchronization
    if (userProfile == null || userProfile.synchronized) {
      return;
    }
​
    // Update the API with the user profile
    await _apiClientService.putUserProfile(userProfile);
​
    // Set the user profile as synchronized
    await _databaseService.updateUserProfile(
      userProfile.copyWith(synchronized: true),
    );
  } catch (e) {
    // Try again later
  }
}
```

content\_copy

A more complex solution uses background processes
like the [`workmanager`](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager)
plugin.
This allows your application to run the synchronization process
in the background even when the application is not running.


It’s also recommended to only perform the synchronization task
when the network is available.
For example, you can use the [`connectivity_plus`](https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity_plus)
plugin
to check if the device is connected to WiFi.
You can also use [`battery_plus`](https://pub.dev/packages/battery_plus)
to verify
that the device is not running low on battery.


In the previous example, the synchronization task runs every 5 minutes.
In some cases, that might be excessive,
while in others it might not be frequent enough.
The actual synchronization period time for your application
depends on your application needs and it’s something you will have to decide.


### Storing a synchronization flag

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#storing-a-synchronization-flag)

To know if the data requires synchronization,
add a flag to the data class indicating if the changes need to be synchronized.


For example, `bool synchronized`:

dart

```
@freezed
abstract class UserProfile with _$UserProfile {
  const factory UserProfile({
    required String name,
    required String photoUrl,
    @Default(false) bool synchronized,
  }) = _UserProfile;
}
```

content\_copy

Your synchronization logic should attempt
to send it to the API service
only when the `synchronized` flag is `false`.
If the request is successful, then change it to `true`.


### Pushing data from server

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#pushing-data-from-server)

A different approach for synchronization
is to use a push service to provide up-to-date data to the application.
In this case, the server notifies the application when data has changed,
instead of being the application asking for updates.


For example, you can use [Firebase messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/flutter/client),
to push small payloads of data to the device,
as well as trigger synchronization tasks remotely using background messages.


Instead of having a synchronization task running in the background,
the server notifies the application
when the stored data needs to be updated with a push notification.


You can combine both approaches together,
having a background synchronization task and using background push messages,
to keep the application database synchronized with the server.


## Putting it all together

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/offline-first#putting-it-all-together)

Writing an offline-first application
requires making decisions regarding
the way read, write and sync operations are implemented,
which depend on the requirements from the application you are developing.


The key takeaways are:

- When reading data,
you can use a `Stream` to combine locally stored data with remote data.

- When writing data,
decide if you need to be online or offline,
and if you need synchronizing data later or not.

- When implementing a background sync task,
take into account the device status and your application needs,
as different applications may have different requirements.

[vertical\_align\_topSecurity](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

The Flutter team takes the security of Flutter and the applications
created with it seriously. This page describes how to report any
vulnerabilities you might find, and lists best practices to minimize
the risk of introducing a vulnerability.


## Security philosophy

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#security-philosophy)

Flutter security strategy is based on five key pillars:

- **Identify**: Track and prioritize key security risks by
identifying core assets, key threats, and vulnerabilities.

- **Detect**: Detect and identify vulnerabilities using
techniques and tools like vulnerability scanning,
static application security testing, and fuzzing.

- **Protect**: Eliminate risks by mitigating known
vulnerabilities and protect critical assets against source threats.

- **Respond**: Define processes to report, triage, and
respond to vulnerabilities or attacks.

- **Recover**: Build capabilities to contain and recover
from an incident with minimal impact.


## Reporting vulnerabilities

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#reporting-vulnerabilities)

Before reporting a security vulnerability found
by a static analysis tool,
consider checking our list of [known false positives](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/security-false-positives).


Report security vulnerabilities to
[https://g.co/vulnz](https://g.co/vulnz) and include
a description of the issue, the steps you took to create
the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations
for the issue. We use g.co/vulnz for our intake, and do
coordination and disclosure on GitHub (including using GitHub
Security Advisory). The Google Security Team will respond
within 5 working days of your report on g.co/vulnz.


You may also reach out to the team via our public Discord
chat channels; however, please also make sure to make
vulnerability reports to g.co/vulnz, and avoid revealing
information about vulnerabilities in public if that could
put users at risk.


You should expect a close collaboration as we work to resolve
the security vulnerability you have reported. Please reach out
to security@flutter.dev only if you do not receive a response
to a g.co/vulnz report within the above mentioned 5 working days.


For more details on how we handle security vulnerabilities,
see our [security policy](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/security/policy).


## Flagging existing issues as security-related

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#flagging-existing-issues-as-security-related)

If you believe that an existing GitHub issue is security-related,
we ask that you both report the issue to g.co/vulnz and send an
email to security@flutter.dev. The email should include the
GitHub issue ID and a short description of why it should be
handled according to this security policy.


Security reports are not tracked explicitly in the GitHub issue
database. We use GitHub's security advisory feature to track
open security reports.


## Supported versions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#supported-versions)

We commit to publishing security updates for the version of
Flutter currently on the `stable` branch.


## Expectations

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#expectations)

We treat security reports equivalent to a P0 priority level.
This means that we attempt to fix them as quickly as possible.
Depending on our release schedule, we will release either a
new beta or a stable hotfix for any major security report
found in the most recent stable version of our SDK, whichever
is most expedient.


Any vulnerability reported for flutter websites like
docs.flutter.dev doesn't require a release and will be
fixed in the website itself.


## Bug Bounty programs

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#bug-bounty-programs)

Non-Google teams that use or contribute to Flutter are also
welcome to include Flutter within the scope of their bug
bounty programs. To have your program listed, please
contact `security@flutter.dev`.


Google considers Flutter to be in scope for the
[Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Reward Program](https://bughunters.google.com/open-source-security).


## Receiving security updates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#receiving-security-updates)

The best way to receive security updates is to subscribe to the
[flutter-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce)
mailing list or watch updates to the
[Discord channel](https://discord.gg/BS8KZyg). We also announce security updates in the
technical release blog post.


## Best practices

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/security#best-practices)

- **Keep current with the latest Flutter SDK releases.**
We regularly update Flutter, and these updates might fix security
defects discovered in previous versions.

- **Keep your application's dependencies up to date.**
Make sure you [upgrade your package dependencies](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/upgrade)

to keep the dependencies up to date.
Avoid pinning to specific versions
for your dependencies and, if you do, make sure you check
periodically to see if your dependencies have had security updates,
and update the pin accordingly.

- **Keep your copy of Flutter up to date.**
Private, customized versions of Flutter tend
to fall behind the current version and might not
include important security fixes and enhancements.
Instead, routinely update your copy of Flutter.
If you're making changes to improve Flutter,
be sure to update your fork and consider sharing your
changes with the community.

## Get the Flutter SDK

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#get-the-flutter-sdk)

### Unable to find the `flutter` command

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#unable-to-find-the-flutter-command)

**What does this issue look like?**

When you try to run the `flutter` command,
the console fails to find it.
The error usually looks as follows:


```
'flutter' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file
```

content\_copy

Error messages on macOS and Linux could look slightly different from
the one on Windows.


**Explanation and suggestions**

Did you add Flutter to the `PATH` environment variable for your platform?
On Windows, follow these [instructions for adding a command\\
to your path](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-PATH-Environment-Variable-on-Windows).


If you've already [set up VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code#setup) for Flutter development,
you can use the Flutter extension's **Locate SDK** prompt
to identify the location of your `flutter` folder.


See also: [Configuring PATH and Environment Variables - Dart Code](https://dartcode.org/docs/configuring-path-and-environment-variables/)

### Flutter in special folders

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#flutter-in-special-folders)

**What does this issue look like?**

Running your Flutter project produces an error like the following:

```
The Flutter SDK is installed in a protected folder and may not function correctly.
Please move the SDK to a location that is user-writable without Administration permissions and restart.
```

content\_copy

**Explanation and suggestions**

On Windows, this usually happens when Flutter is installed
in a directory like
`C:\Program Files\` that requires elevated privileges.
Try relocating Flutter to a different folder,
such as `C:\src\flutter`.


### Invoke-Expression: You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#invoke-expression-you-cannot-call-a-method-on-a-null-valued-expression)

**What does this issue look like?**

When running `flutter doctor` on Windows, you might see an error like:

```
Invoke-Expression : You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.
At ...\update_engine_version.ps1:60 char:20
```

content\_copy

**Explanation and suggestions**

This error typically occurs when the `SystemRoot` environment variable is missing
or when the PowerShell execution policy prevents the script from running correctly.


To resolve this:

1. **Run as Administrator**:
    Open your PowerShell terminal as an Administrator.

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
    Ensure the `SystemRoot` environment variable is set (usually to `C:\Windows`). You can check its value by running
    `echo $env:SystemRoot` in your PowerShell terminal.

3. **Check Execution Policy**:
    If the issue persists, you might need to adjust your execution policy.
    Run the following command in an Administrator PowerShell window:



powershell

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Android setup

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#android-setup)

### Having multiple versions of Java installed

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#having-multiple-versions-of-java-installed)

**What does this issue look like?**

The command `flutter doctor --android-licenses` fails.
Running `flutter doctor --verbose` gives an error message
like the following:


```
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/android/prefs/AndroidLocationsProvider
has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0),
this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0
```

content\_copy

**Explanation and suggestions**

The error occurs when an older version of the
Java Development Kit (JDK)
is installed on your computer.


If you don't need multiple versions of Java,
uninstall existing JDKs from your computer.
Flutter automatically uses the JDK included in Android Studio.


If you do need another version of Java,
try the workaround described in
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/106416#issuecomment-1522198064)

until a long-term solution is implemented.
For more information,
check out the [Android Java Gradle migration guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/android-java-gradle-migration-guide)

or [flutter doctor --android-licenses not working due to\\
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75328050/).


### `cmdline-tools` component is missing

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#cmdline-tools-component-is-missing)

**What does this issue look like?**

The `flutter doctor` command complains that the
`cmdline-tools` are missing from the Android toolchain.
For example:


```
[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 33.0.2)
    • Android SDK at C:\Users\My PC\AppData\Local\Android\sdk
    X cmdline-tools component is missing
```

content\_copy

**Explanation and suggestions**

The easiest way to get the cmdline-tools is through the
SDK Manager in Android Studio.
To do this, use the following instructions:


1. Open the SDK Manager from Android Studio by
    selecting **Tools > SDK Manager** from the menu bar.

2. Select the latest Android SDK
    (or a specific version that your app requires),
    Android SDK Command-line Tools, and Android SDK Build-Tools.

3. Click **Apply** to install the selected artifacts.

![Android Studio SDK Manager](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/get-started/install_android_tools.png)

If you're not using Android Studio,
you can download the tools using the
[sdkmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager)
command-line tool.


## macOS setup

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#macos-setup)

### SocketException: Send failed, OS Error: No route to host, errno = 65

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#socketexception-send-failed-os-error-no-route-to-host-errno-65)

**What does this issue look like?**

On macOS, the `flutter run` command produces an error like:

```
$ flutter run
Launching lib/main.dart in debug mode...
...
Installing and launching...
Oops; flutter has exited unexpectedly: "SocketException: Send failed (OS Error: No route to host, errno = 65), address = 0.0.0.0, port = 5353".
```

content\_copy

**Explanation and suggestions**

This issue is related to macOS permissions.

To fix this:

1. Upgrade your Flutter SDK to the latest version.

2. Open **System Settings** \> **Privacy & Security** \> **Local Network**.
    Toggle on the permission for all the code editors and terminals you use to
    launch Flutter apps.
    You might need to restart your code editor, terminal, and physical device.


## Other problems

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#other-problems)

### Exit code 69

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#exit-code-69)

**What does this issue look like?**

Running a `flutter` command produces an "exit code: 69" error,
as shown in the following example:


```
Running "flutter pub get" in flutter_tools...
Resolving dependencies in .../flutter/packages/flutter_tools... (28.0s)
Got TLS error trying to find package test at https://pub.dev/.
pub get failed
command:

pub env: {
  "FLUTTER_ROOT": ".../flutter",
  "PUB_ENVIRONMENT": "flutter_cli:get",
  "PUB_CACHE": ".../.pub-cache",
}
exit code: 69
```

content\_copy

**Explanation and suggestions**

This issue is related to networking.
Try the following instructions to troubleshoot:


- Check your internet connection.
Make sure that you're connected to the
internet and that your connection is stable.

- Restart your devices, including your computer
and networking equipment.

- Use a VPN to help to bypass any restrictions that
might prevent you from connecting to the network.

- If you have tried all of these steps and are
still getting the error, print out verbose logs
with the `flutter doctor -v` command and ask for help in
one of the [community support channels](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot#community-support).

[vertical\_align\_topIntroduction to animations](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Well-designed animations make a UI feel more intuitive,
contribute to the slick look and feel of a polished app,
and improve the user experience.
Flutter's animation support makes it easy to implement a variety of
animation types. Many widgets, especially [Material widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/material),
come with the standard motion effects defined in their design spec,
but it's also possible to customize these effects.


## Choosing an approach

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#choosing-an-approach)

There are different approaches you can take when creating
animations in Flutter. Which approach is right for you?
To help you decide, check out the video,
[How to choose which Flutter Animation Widget is right for you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXIJJkq_H8g)

(Also published as a [_companion article_](https://blog.flutter.dev/how-to-choose-which-flutter-animation-widget-is-right-for-you-79ecfb7e72b5).)


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "How to choose which Flutter animation widget is right for your use case"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/GXIJJkq_H8g)

(To dive deeper into the decision process,
watch the [Animations in Flutter done right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnARLByOtKA&t=3s)
video,
presented at Flutter Europe.)


As shown in the video, the following
decision tree helps you decide what approach
to use when implementing a Flutter animation:

### Built-in explicit animations

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#built-in-explicit-animations)

To create an explicit animation (where you control the animation,
rather than letting the framework control it), perhaps
you can use one of the built-in explicit animations classes.

## Animation types

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#animation-types)

Generally, animations are either tween- or physics-based.
The following sections explain what these terms mean,
and point you to resources where you can learn more.


### Tween animation

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#tween-animation)

Short for _in-betweening_. In a tween animation, the beginning
and ending points are defined, as well as a timeline, and a curve
that defines the timing and speed of the transition.
The framework calculates how to transition from the beginning point
to the end point.


- See the [Animations tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations/tutorial), which uses tweens in the examples.

- Also see the API documentation for [`Tween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html),
[`CurveTween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurveTween-class.html), and
[`TweenSequence`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/TweenSequence-class.html).


### Physics-based animation

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#physics-based-animation)

In physics-based animation, motion is modeled to resemble real-world
behavior. When you toss a ball, for example, where and when it lands
depends on how fast it was tossed and how far it was from the ground.
Similarly, dropping a ball attached to a spring falls
(and bounces) differently than dropping a ball attached to a string.


- [Animate a widget using a physics simulation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/animation/physics-simulation)



A recipe in the animations section of the Flutter cookbook.

- Also see the API documentation for
[`AnimationController.animateWith`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController/animateWith.html)
and
[`SpringSimulation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/physics/SpringSimulation-class.html).


## Common animation patterns

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#common-animation-patterns)

Most UX or motion designers find that certain
animation patterns are used repeatedly when designing a UI.
This section lists some of the commonly
used animation patterns, and tells you where to learn more.


### Animated list or grid

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#animated-list-or-grid)

This pattern involves animating the addition or removal of
elements from a list or grid.


- [`AnimatedList` example](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/main/animations)



This demo, from the [Sample app catalog](https://github.com/flutter/samples), shows how to
animate adding an element to a list, or removing a selected element.
The internal Dart list is synced as the user modifies the list using
the plus (+) and minus (-) buttons.


### Shared element transition

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#shared-element-transition)

In this pattern, the user selects an element—often an
image—from the page, and the UI animates the selected element
to a new page with more detail. In Flutter, you can easily implement
shared element transitions between routes (pages)
using the `Hero` widget.


- [Hero animations](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations/hero-animations)
How to create two styles of Hero animations:
  - The hero flies from one page to another while changing position
     and size.
  - The hero's boundary changes shape, from a circle to a square,
     as its flies from one page to another.
- Also see the API documentation for the
[`Hero`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Hero-class.html),
[`Navigator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html), and
[`PageRoute`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PageRoute-class.html) classes.


### Staggered animation

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#staggered-animation)

Animations that are broken into smaller motions,
where some of the motion is delayed.
The smaller animations might be sequential,
or might partially or completely overlap.


- [Staggered Animations](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations/staggered-animations)

## Essential animation concepts and classes

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#essential-animation-concepts-and-classes)

The animation system in Flutter is based on typed
[`Animation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html)
objects. Widgets can either incorporate
these animations in their build functions directly by
reading their current value and listening to their state
changes or they can use the animations as the basis of
more elaborate animations that they pass along to
other widgets.


### Animation<double>

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#animationwbrdouble)

In Flutter, an `Animation` object knows nothing about what
is onscreen. An `Animation` is an abstract class that
understands its current value and its state (completed or dismissed).
One of the more commonly used animation types is `Animation<double>`.


An `Animation` object sequentially generates
interpolated numbers between two values over a certain duration.
The output of an `Animation` object might be linear,
a curve, a step function, or any other mapping you can create.
Depending on how the `Animation` object is controlled,
it could run in reverse, or even switch directions in the
middle.


Animations can also interpolate types other than double, such as
`Animation<Color>` or `Animation<Size>`.


An `Animation` object has state. Its current value is
always available in the `.value` member.


An `Animation` object knows nothing about rendering or
`build()` functions.


### CurvedAnimation

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#curvedanimation)

A [`CurvedAnimation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurvedAnimation-class.html)
defines the animation's progress
as a non-linear curve.


dart

```
animation = CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn);
```

content\_copy

`CurvedAnimation` and `AnimationController` (described in the next sections)
are both of type `Animation<double>`, so you can pass them interchangeably.
The `CurvedAnimation` wraps the object it's modifying—you
don't subclass `AnimationController` to implement a curve.


You can use [`Curves`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html)
with `CurvedAnimation`. The `Curves` class defines
many commonly used curves, or you can create your own. For example:


dart

```
import 'dart:math';
​
class ShakeCurve extends Curve {
  @override
  double transform(double t) => sin(t * pi * 2);
}
```

content\_copy

If you want to apply an animation curve to a `Tween`, consider using
[`CurveTween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurveTween-class.html).


### AnimationController

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#animationcontroller)

[`AnimationController`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html)
is a special `Animation`
object that generates a new value whenever the hardware
is ready for a new frame. By default,
an `AnimationController` linearly produces the numbers
from 0.0 to 1.0 during a given duration.
For example, this code creates an `Animation` object,
but does not start it running:


dart

```
controller = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
  vsync: this,
);
```

content\_copy

`AnimationController` derives from `Animation<double>`, so it can be used
wherever an `Animation` object is needed. However, the `AnimationController`

has additional methods to control the animation. For example, you start
an animation with the `.forward()` method. The generation of numbers is
tied to the screen refresh, so typically 60 numbers are generated per
second. After each number is generated, each `Animation` object calls the
attached `Listener` objects. To create a custom display list for each
child, see [`RepaintBoundary`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RepaintBoundary-class.html).


When creating an `AnimationController`, you pass it a `vsync` argument.
The presence of `vsync` prevents offscreen animations from consuming
unnecessary resources.
You can use your stateful object as the vsync by adding
`SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` to the class definition.
You can see an example of this in [animate1](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/animation/animate1)
on GitHub.


### Tween

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#tween)

By default, the `AnimationController` object ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.
If you need a different range or a different data type, you can use a
[`Tween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html)
to configure an animation to interpolate to a
different range or data type. For example, the
following `Tween` goes from -200.0 to 0.0:


dart

```
tween = Tween<double>(begin: -200, end: 0);
```

content\_copy

A `Tween` is a stateless object that takes only `begin` and `end`.
The sole job of a `Tween` is to define a mapping from an
input range to an output range. The input range is commonly
0.0 to 1.0, but that's not a requirement.


A `Tween` inherits from `Animatable<T>`, not from `Animation<T>`.
An `Animatable`, like `Animation`, doesn't have to output double.
For example, `ColorTween` specifies a progression between two colors.


dart

```
colorTween = ColorTween(begin: Colors.transparent, end: Colors.black54);
```

content\_copy

A `Tween` object doesn't store any state. Instead, it provides the
[`evaluate(Animation<double> animation)`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation/value.html)
method that uses the
`transform` function to map the current value of the animation
(between 0.0 and 1.0), to the actual animation value.


The current value of the `Animation` object can be found in the
`.value` method. The evaluate function also performs some housekeeping,
such as ensuring that begin and end are returned when the
animation values are 0.0 and 1.0, respectively.


#### Tween.animate

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#tween-animate)

To use a `Tween` object, call `animate()` on the `Tween`,
passing in the controller object. For example,
the following code generates the
integer values from 0 to 255 over the course of 500 ms.


dart

```
AnimationController controller = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  vsync: this,
);
Animation<int> alpha = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(controller);
```

content\_copy

The following example shows a controller, a curve, and a `Tween`:

dart

```
AnimationController controller = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  vsync: this,
);
final Animation<double> curve = CurvedAnimation(
  parent: controller,
  curve: Curves.easeOut,
);
Animation<int> alpha = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(curve);
```

content\_copy

### Animation notifications

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations#animation-notifications)

An [`Animation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html)
object can have `Listener`s and `StatusListener`s,
defined with `addListener()` and `addStatusListener()`.
A `Listener` is called whenever the value of the animation changes.
The most common behavior of a `Listener` is to call `setState()`

to cause a rebuild. A `StatusListener` is called when an animation begins,
ends, moves forward, or moves reverse, as defined by `AnimationStatus`.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes
inspiration from [React](https://react.dev/). The central idea is that you build
your UI out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view
should look like given their current configuration and state.
When a widget's state changes, the widget rebuilds its description,
which the framework diffs against the previous description in order
to determine the minimal changes needed in the underlying render
tree to transition from one state to the next.


## Hello world

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#hello-world)

The minimal Flutter app simply calls the [`runApp()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/runApp.html)

function with a widget:


The `runApp()` function takes the given
[`Widget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html#widget)
and makes it the root of the widget tree.
In this example, the widget tree consists of two widgets,
the [`Center`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html)
widget and its child, the [`Text`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html)
widget.
The framework forces the root widget to cover the screen,
which means the text "Hello, world" ends up centered on screen.
The text direction needs to be specified in this instance;
when the `MaterialApp` widget is used,
this is taken care of for you, as demonstrated later.


When writing an app, you'll commonly author new widgets that
are subclasses of either [`StatelessWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html)
or [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html),
depending on whether your widget manages any state.
A widget's main job is to implement a [`build()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html)
function,
which describes the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets.
The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process
bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying [`RenderObject`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html),
which computes and describes the geometry of the widget.


## Basic widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#basic-widgets)

Flutter comes with a suite of powerful basic widgets,
of which the following are commonly used:


**[`Text`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html)**

The `Text` widget lets you create a run of styled text
within your application.


**[`Row`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html)**
**,**
**[`Column`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html)**

These flex widgets let you create flexible layouts in
both the horizontal (`Row`) and vertical (`Column`) directions.
The design of these objects is based on the web's
flexbox layout model.


**[`Stack`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html)**

Instead of being linearly oriented (either horizontally or vertically),
a `Stack` widget lets you place widgets on top of each other in paint order.
You can then use the [`Positioned`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Positioned-class.html)
widget on children of a
`Stack` to position them relative to the top, right, bottom,
or left edge of the stack. Stacks are based on the web's
absolute positioning layout model.


**[`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html)**

The `Container` widget lets you create a rectangular visual element.
A container can be decorated with a [`BoxDecoration`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/BoxDecoration-class.html), such as a
background, a border, or a shadow. A `Container` can also have margins,
padding, and constraints applied to its size. In addition, a
`Container` can be transformed in three-dimensional space using a matrix.


Below are some simple widgets that combine these and other widgets:

Be sure to have a `uses-material-design: true` entry in the `flutter`
section of your `pubspec.yaml` file. It allows you to use the predefined
set of [Material icons](https://design.google.com/icons/). It's generally a good idea to include this line
if you are using the Materials library.


yaml

```
name: my_app
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

content\_copy

Many Material Design widgets need to be inside of a [`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)

to display properly, in order to inherit theme data.
Therefore, run the application with a `MaterialApp`.


The `MyAppBar` widget creates a [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html)
with a height of 56
device-independent pixels with an internal padding of 8 pixels,
both on the left and the right. Inside the container,
`MyAppBar` uses a [`Row`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html)
layout to organize its children.
The middle child, the `title` widget, is marked as [`Expanded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html),
which means it expands to fill any remaining available space
that hasn't been consumed by the other children.
You can have multiple `Expanded` children and determine the
ratio in which they consume the available space using the
[`flex`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html#flex)
argument to `Expanded`.


The `MyScaffold` widget organizes its children in a vertical column.
At the top of the column it places an instance of `MyAppBar`,
passing the app bar a [`Text`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html)
widget to use as its title.
Passing widgets as arguments to other widgets is a powerful technique
that lets you create generic widgets that can be reused in a wide
variety of ways. Finally, `MyScaffold` uses an
[`Expanded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html)
to fill the remaining space with its body,
which consists of a centered message.


For more information, check out [Layouts](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/layout).

## Using Material Components

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#using-material-components)

Flutter provides a number of widgets that help you build apps
that follow Material Design. A Material app starts with the
[`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)
widget, which builds a number of useful widgets
at the root of your app, including a [`Navigator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html),
which manages a stack of widgets identified by strings,
also known as "routes". The `Navigator` lets you transition smoothly
between screens of your application. Using the [`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html)

widget is entirely optional but a good practice.


Now that the code has switched from `MyAppBar` and `MyScaffold` to the
[`AppBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html)
and [`Scaffold`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html)
widgets, and from `material.dart`,
the app is starting to look a bit more Material.
For example, the app bar has a shadow and the title text inherits the
correct styling automatically. A floating action button is also added.


Notice that widgets are passed as arguments to other widgets.
The [`Scaffold`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html)
widget takes a number of different widgets as
named arguments, each of which are placed in the `Scaffold`
layout in the appropriate place. Similarly, the
[`AppBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html)
widget lets you pass in widgets for the
[`leading`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html#leading)
widget, and the [`actions`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html#actions)
of the [`title`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html#title)
widget.
This pattern recurs throughout the framework and is something you
might consider when designing your own widgets.


For more information, check out [Material Components widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/material).

## Handling gestures

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#handling-gestures)

Most applications include some form of user interaction with the system.
The first step in building an interactive application is to detect
input gestures. See how that works by creating a simple button:


The [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
widget doesn't have a visual
representation but instead detects gestures made by the
user. When the user taps the [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html),
the `GestureDetector` calls its [`onTap()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html#onTap)
callback, in this
case printing a message to the console. You can use
`GestureDetector` to detect a variety of input gestures,
including taps, drags, and scales.


Many widgets use a [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
to provide
optional callbacks for other widgets. For example, the
[`IconButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html),
[`ElevatedButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html), and
[`FloatingActionButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FloatingActionButton-class.html)
widgets have [`onPressed()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html#onPressed)

callbacks that are triggered when the user taps the widget.


For more information, check out [Gestures in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/gestures).

## Changing widgets in response to input

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#changing-widgets-in-response-to-input)

So far, this page has used only stateless widgets.
Stateless widgets receive arguments from their parent widget,
which they store in [`final`](https://dart.dev/language/variables#final-and-const)
member variables.
When a widget is asked to [`build()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html), it uses these stored
values to derive new arguments for the widgets it creates.


In order to build more complex experiences—for example,
to react in more interesting ways to user input—applications
typically carry some state. Flutter uses `StatefulWidgets` to capture
this idea. `StatefulWidgets` are special widgets that know how to generate
`State` objects, which are then used to hold state.
Consider this basic example, using the [`ElevatedButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html)
mentioned earlier:


You might wonder why `StatefulWidget` and `State` are separate objects.
In Flutter, these two types of objects have different life cycles.
`Widgets` are temporary objects, used to construct a presentation of
the application in its current state. `State` objects, on the other
hand, are persistent between calls to
`build()`, allowing them to remember information.


The example above accepts user input and directly uses
the result in its `build()` method. In more complex applications,
different parts of the widget hierarchy might be
responsible for different concerns; for example, one
widget might present a complex user interface
with the goal of gathering specific information,
such as a date or location, while another widget might
use that information to change the overall presentation.


In Flutter, change notifications flow "up" the widget
hierarchy by way of callbacks, while current state flows
"down" to the stateless widgets that do presentation.
The common parent that redirects this flow is the `State`.
The following slightly more complex example shows how
this works in practice:


Notice the creation of two new stateless widgets,
cleanly separating the concerns of _displaying_ the counter
(`CounterDisplay`) and _changing_ the counter (`CounterIncrementor`).
Although the net result is the same as the previous example,
the separation of responsibility allows greater complexity to
be encapsulated in the individual widgets,
while maintaining simplicity in the parent.


For more information, check out:

- [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html)
- [`setState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html)

## Bringing it all together

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#bringing-it-all-together)

What follows is a more complete example that brings together
these concepts: A hypothetical shopping application displays various
products offered for sale, and maintains a shopping cart for
intended purchases. Start by defining the presentation class,
`ShoppingListItem`:


The `ShoppingListItem` widget follows a common pattern
for stateless widgets. It stores the values it receives
in its constructor in [`final`](https://dart.dev/language/variables#final-and-const)
member variables,
which it then uses during its [`build()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html)
function.
For example, the `inCart` boolean toggles between two visual
appearances: one that uses the primary color from the current
theme, and another that uses gray.


When the user taps the list item, the widget doesn't modify
its `inCart` value directly. Instead, the widget calls the
`onCartChanged` function it received from its parent widget.
This pattern lets you store state higher in the widget
hierarchy, which causes the state to persist for longer periods of time.
In the extreme, the state stored on the widget passed to
[`runApp()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/runApp.html)
persists for the lifetime of the
application.


When the parent receives the `onCartChanged` callback,
the parent updates its internal state, which triggers
the parent to rebuild and create a new instance
of `ShoppingListItem` with the new `inCart` value.
Although the parent creates a new instance of
`ShoppingListItem` when it rebuilds, that operation is cheap
because the framework compares the newly built widgets with the previously
built widgets and applies only the differences to the underlying
[`RenderObject`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html).


Here's an example parent widget that stores mutable state:

The `ShoppingList` class extends [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html),
which means this widget stores mutable state.
When the `ShoppingList` widget is first inserted
into the tree, the framework calls the [`createState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html#createState)
function
to create a fresh instance of `_ShoppingListState` to associate with that
location in the tree. (Notice that subclasses of
[`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html)
are typically named with leading underscores to
indicate that they are private implementation details.)
When this widget's parent rebuilds, the parent creates a new instance
of `ShoppingList`, but the framework reuses the `_ShoppingListState`

instance that is already in the tree rather than calling
`createState` again.


To access properties of the current `ShoppingList`,
the `_ShoppingListState` can use its [`widget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html#widget)
property.
If the parent rebuilds and creates a new `ShoppingList`,
the `_ShoppingListState` rebuilds with the new widget value.
If you wish to be notified when the `widget` property changes,
override the [`didUpdateWidget()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html#didUpdateWidget)
function, which is passed
an `oldWidget` to let you compare the old widget with
the current widget.


When handling the `onCartChanged` callback, the `_ShoppingListState`
mutates its internal state by either adding or removing a product from
`_shoppingCart`. To signal to the framework that it changed its internal
state, it wraps those calls in a [`setState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html)
call.
Calling `setState` marks this widget as dirty and schedules it to be rebuilt
the next time your app needs to update the screen.
If you forget to call `setState` when modifying the internal
state of a widget, the framework won't know your widget is
dirty and might not call the widget's [`build()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html)
function,
which means the user interface might not update to reflect
the changed state. By managing state in this way,
you don't need to write separate code for creating and
updating child widgets. Instead, you simply implement the `build`
function, which handles both situations.


## Responding to widget lifecycle events

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#responding-to-widget-lifecycle-events)

After calling [`createState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html#createState)
on the `StatefulWidget`,
the framework inserts the new state object into the tree and
then calls [`initState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html#initState)
on the state object.
A subclass of [`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html)
can override `initState` to do work
that needs to happen just once. For example, override `initState`
to configure animations or to subscribe to platform services.
Implementations of `initState` are required to start
by calling `super.initState`.


When a state object is no longer needed,
the framework calls [`dispose()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html#dispose)
on the state object.
Override the `dispose` function to do cleanup work.
For example, override `dispose` to cancel timers or to
unsubscribe from platform services. Implementations of
`dispose` typically end by calling `super.dispose`.


For more information, check out [`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html).


## Keys

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#keys)

Use keys to control which widgets the framework matches up
with other widgets when a widget rebuilds. By default, the
framework matches widgets in the current and previous build
according to their [`runtimeType`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html#runtimeType)
and the order in which they appear.
With keys, the framework requires that the two widgets have
the same [`key`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html#key)
as well as the same `runtimeType`.


Keys are most useful in widgets that build many instances of
the same type of widget. For example, the `ShoppingList` widget,
which builds just enough `ShoppingListItem` instances to
fill its visible region:


- Without keys, the first entry in the current build
would always sync with the first entry in the previous build,
even if, semantically, the first entry in the list just
scrolled off screen and is no longer visible in the viewport.

- By assigning each entry in the list a "semantic" key,
the infinite list can be more efficient because the
framework syncs entries with matching semantic keys
and therefore similar (or identical) visual appearances.
Moreover, syncing the entries semantically means that
state retained in stateful child widgets remains attached
to the same semantic entry rather than the entry in the
same numerical position in the viewport.


For more information, check out the [`Key`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Widget-class.html#key)
API.


## Global keys

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui#global-keys)

Use global keys to uniquely identify child widgets.
Global keys must be globally unique across the entire
widget hierarchy, unlike local keys which need
only be unique among siblings. Because they are
globally unique, a global key can be used to
retrieve the state associated with a widget.


For more information, check out the [`GlobalKey`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GlobalKey-class.html)
API.

This page describes how to bind physical keyboard events to actions in the user
interface. For instance, to define keyboard shortcuts in your application, this
page is for you.


## Overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#overview)

For a GUI application to do anything, it has to have actions: users want to tell
the application to _do_ something. Actions are often simple functions that
directly perform the action (such as set a value or save a file). In a larger
application, however, things are more complex: the code for invoking the action,
and the code for the action itself might need to be in different places.
Shortcuts (key bindings) might need definition at a level that knows nothing
about the actions they invoke.


That's where Flutter's actions and shortcuts system comes in. It allows
developers to define actions that fulfill intents bound to them. In this
context, an intent is a generic action that the user wishes to perform, and an
[`Intent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Intent-class.html)
class instance represents these user intents in Flutter. An
`Intent` can be general purpose, fulfilled by different actions in different
contexts. An [`Action`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Action-class.html)
can be a simple callback (as in the case of
the [`CallbackAction`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CallbackAction-class.html)) or something more complex that integrates with entire
undo/redo architectures (for example) or other logic.


![Using Shortcuts Diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/using_shortcuts.png)

[`Shortcuts`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Shortcuts-class.html) are key bindings that activate by pressing a key or combination
of keys. The key combinations reside in a table with their bound intent. When
the `Shortcuts` widget invokes them, it sends their matching intent to the
actions subsystem for fulfillment.


To illustrate the concepts in actions and shortcuts, this article creates a
simple app that allows a user to select and copy text in a text field using both
buttons and shortcuts.


### Why separate Actions from Intents?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#why-separate-actions-from-intents)

You might wonder: why not just map a key combination directly to an action? Why
have intents at all? This is because it is useful to have a separation of
concerns between where the key mapping definitions are (often at a high level),
and where the action definitions are (often at a low level), and because it is
important to be able to have a single key combination map to an intended
operation in an app, and have it adapt automatically to whichever action
fulfills that intended operation for the focused context.


For instance, Flutter has an `ActivateIntent` widget that maps each type of
control to its corresponding version of an `ActivateAction` (and that executes
the code that activates the control). This code often needs fairly private
access to do its work. If the extra layer of indirection that `Intent`s provide
didn't exist, it would be necessary to elevate the definition of the actions to
where the defining instance of the `Shortcuts` widget could see them, causing
the shortcuts to have more knowledge than necessary about which action to
invoke, and to have access to or provide state that it wouldn't necessarily have
or need otherwise. This allows your code to separate the two concerns to be more
independent.


Intents configure an action so that the same action can serve multiple uses. An
example of this is `DirectionalFocusIntent`, which takes a direction to move
the focus in, allowing the `DirectionalFocusAction` to know which direction to
move the focus. Just be careful: don't pass state in the `Intent` that applies
to all invocations of an `Action`: that kind of state should be passed to the
constructor of the `Action` itself, to keep the `Intent` from needing to know
too much.


### Why not use callbacks?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#why-not-use-callbacks)

You also might wonder: why not just use a callback instead of an `Action`
object? The main reason is that it's useful for actions to decide whether they
are enabled by implementing `isEnabled`. Also, it is often helpful if the key
bindings, and the implementation of those bindings, are in different places.


If all you need are callbacks without the flexibility of `Actions` and
`Shortcuts`, you can use the [`CallbackShortcuts`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CallbackShortcuts-class.html)
widget:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return CallbackShortcuts(
    bindings: <ShortcutActivator, VoidCallback>{
      const SingleActivator(LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowUp): () {
        setState(() => count = count + 1);
      },
      const SingleActivator(LogicalKeyboardKey.arrowDown): () {
        setState(() => count = count - 1);
      },
    },
    child: Focus(
      autofocus: true,
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[\
          const Text('Press the up arrow key to add to the counter'),\
          const Text('Press the down arrow key to subtract from the counter'),\
          Text('count: $count'),\
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

## Shortcuts

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#shortcuts)

As you'll see below, actions are useful on their own, but the most common use
case involves binding them to a keyboard shortcut. This is what the `Shortcuts`

widget is for.


It is inserted into the widget hierarchy to define key combinations that
represent the user's intent when that key combination is pressed. To convert
that intended purpose for the key combination into a concrete action, the
`Actions` widget used to map the `Intent` to an `Action`. For instance, you can
define a `SelectAllIntent`, and bind it to your own `SelectAllAction`
or to your
`CanvasSelectAllAction`, and from that one key binding, the system invokes
either one, depending on which part of your application has focus. Let's see how
the key binding part works:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Shortcuts(
    shortcuts: <LogicalKeySet, Intent>{
      LogicalKeySet(LogicalKeyboardKey.control, LogicalKeyboardKey.keyA):
          const SelectAllIntent(),
    },
    child: Actions(
      dispatcher: LoggingActionDispatcher(),
      actions: <Type, Action<Intent>>{
        SelectAllIntent: SelectAllAction(model),
      },
      child: Builder(
        builder: (context) => TextButton(
          onPressed: Actions.handler<SelectAllIntent>(
            context,
            const SelectAllIntent(),
          ),
          child: const Text('SELECT ALL'),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

The map given to a `Shortcuts` widget maps a `LogicalKeySet` (or a
`ShortcutActivator`, see note below) to an `Intent` instance. The logical key
set defines a set of one or more keys, and the intent indicates the intended
purpose of the keypress. The `Shortcuts` widget looks up key presses in the map,
to find an `Intent` instance, which it gives to the action's `invoke()`
method.


### The ShortcutManager

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#the-shortcutmanager)

The shortcut manager, a longer-lived object than the `Shortcuts` widget, passes
on key events when it receives them. It contains the logic for deciding how to
handle the keys, the logic for walking up the tree to find other shortcut
mappings, and maintains a map of key combinations to intents.


While the default behavior of the `ShortcutManager` is usually desirable, the
`Shortcuts` widget takes a `ShortcutManager` that you can subclass to customize
its functionality.


For example, if you wanted to log each key that a `Shortcuts` widget handled,
you could make a `LoggingShortcutManager`:


dart

```
class LoggingShortcutManager extends ShortcutManager {
  @override
  KeyEventResult handleKeypress(BuildContext context, KeyEvent event) {
    final KeyEventResult result = super.handleKeypress(context, event);
    if (result == KeyEventResult.handled) {
      print('Handled shortcut $event in $context');
    }
    return result;
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Now, every time the `Shortcuts` widget handles a shortcut, it prints out the key
event and relevant context.


## Actions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#actions)

`Actions` allow for the definition of operations that the application can
perform by invoking them with an `Intent`. Actions can be enabled or disabled,
and receive the intent instance that invoked them as an argument to allow
configuration by the intent.


### Defining actions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#defining-actions)

Actions, in their simplest form, are just subclasses of `Action<Intent>` with an
`invoke()` method. Here's a simple action that simply invokes a function on the
provided model:


dart

```
class SelectAllAction extends Action<SelectAllIntent> {
  SelectAllAction(this.model);
​
  final Model model;
​
  @override
  void invoke(covariant SelectAllIntent intent) => model.selectAll();
}
```

content\_copy

Or, if it's too much of a bother to create a new class, use a `CallbackAction`:

dart

```
CallbackAction(onInvoke: (intent) => model.selectAll());
```

content\_copy

Once you have an action, you add it to your application using the [`Actions`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Actions-class.html)

widget, which takes a map of `Intent` types to `Action`s:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Actions(
    actions: <Type, Action<Intent>>{SelectAllIntent: SelectAllAction(model)},
    child: child,
  );
}
```

content\_copy

The `Shortcuts` widget uses the `Focus` widget's context and `Actions.invoke`
to
find which action to invoke. If the `Shortcuts` widget doesn't find a matching
intent type in the first `Actions` widget encountered, it considers the next
ancestor `Actions` widget, and so on, until it reaches the root of the widget
tree, or finds a matching intent type and invokes the corresponding action.


### Invoking Actions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#invoking-actions)

The actions system has several ways to invoke actions. By far the most common
way is through the use of a `Shortcuts` widget covered in the previous section,
but there are other ways to interrogate the actions subsystem and invoke an
action. It's possible to invoke actions that are not bound to keys.


For instance, to find an action associated with an intent, you can use:

dart

```
Action<SelectAllIntent>? selectAll = Actions.maybeFind<SelectAllIntent>(
  context,
);
```

content\_copy

This returns an `Action` associated with the `SelectAllIntent` type if one is
available in the given `context`. If one isn't available, it returns null. If
an associated `Action` should always be available, then use `find`
instead of
`maybeFind`, which throws an exception when it doesn't find a matching
`Intent`
type.


To invoke the action (if it exists), call:

dart

```
Object? result;
if (selectAll != null) {
  result = Actions.of(
    context,
  ).invokeAction(selectAll, const SelectAllIntent());
}
```

content\_copy

Combine that into one call with the following:

dart

```
Object? result = Actions.maybeInvoke<SelectAllIntent>(
  context,
  const SelectAllIntent(),
);
```

content\_copy

Sometimes you want to invoke an action as a
result of pressing a button or another control.
You can do this with the `Actions.handler` function.
If the intent has a mapping to an enabled action,
the `Actions.handler` function creates a handler closure.
However, if it doesn't have a mapping, it returns `null`.
This allows the button to be disabled if
there is no enabled action that matches in the context.


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Actions(
    actions: <Type, Action<Intent>>{SelectAllIntent: SelectAllAction(model)},
    child: Builder(
      builder: (context) => TextButton(
        onPressed: Actions.handler<SelectAllIntent>(
          context,
          SelectAllIntent(controller: controller),
        ),
        child: const Text('SELECT ALL'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

The `Actions` widget only invokes actions when `isEnabled(Intent intent)`
returns true, allowing the action to decide if the dispatcher should consider it
for invocation. If the action isn't enabled, then the `Actions` widget gives
another enabled action higher in the widget hierarchy (if it exists) a chance to
execute.


The previous example uses a `Builder` because `Actions.handler` and
`Actions.invoke` (for example) only finds actions in the provided `context`, and
if the example passes the `context` given to the `build` function, the framework
starts looking _above_ the current widget. Using a `Builder` allows the
framework to find the actions defined in the same `build` function.


You can invoke an action without needing a `BuildContext`, but since the
`Actions` widget requires a context to find an enabled action to invoke, you
need to provide one, either by creating your own `Action` instance, or by
finding one in an appropriate context with `Actions.find`.


To invoke the action, pass the action to the `invoke` method on an
`ActionDispatcher`, either one you created yourself, or one retrieved from an
existing `Actions` widget using the `Actions.of(context)` method. Check whether
the action is enabled before calling `invoke`. Of course, you can also just call
`invoke` on the action itself, passing an `Intent`, but then you opt out of any
services that an action dispatcher might provide (like logging, undo/redo, and
so on).


### Action dispatchers

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#action-dispatchers)

Most of the time, you just want to invoke an action, have it do its thing, and
forget about it. Sometimes, however, you might want to log the executed actions.


This is where replacing the default `ActionDispatcher` with a custom dispatcher
comes in. You pass your `ActionDispatcher` to the `Actions`
widget, and it
invokes actions from any `Actions` widgets below that one that doesn't set a
dispatcher of its own.


The first thing `Actions` does when invoking an action is look up the
`ActionDispatcher` and pass the action to it for invocation. If there is none,
it creates a default `ActionDispatcher` that simply invokes the action.


If you want a log of all the actions invoked, however, you can create your own
`LoggingActionDispatcher` to do the job:


dart

```
class LoggingActionDispatcher extends ActionDispatcher {
  @override
  Object? invokeAction(
    covariant Action<Intent> action,
    covariant Intent intent, [\
    BuildContext? context,\
  ]) {
    print('Action invoked: $action($intent) from $context');
    super.invokeAction(action, intent, context);
​
    return null;
  }
​
  @override
  (bool, Object?) invokeActionIfEnabled(
    covariant Action<Intent> action,
    covariant Intent intent, [\
    BuildContext? context,\
  ]) {
    print('Action invoked: $action($intent) from $context');
    return super.invokeActionIfEnabled(action, intent, context);
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Then you pass that to your top-level `Actions` widget:

dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Actions(
    dispatcher: LoggingActionDispatcher(),
    actions: <Type, Action<Intent>>{SelectAllIntent: SelectAllAction(model)},
    child: Builder(
      builder: (context) => TextButton(
        onPressed: Actions.handler<SelectAllIntent>(
          context,
          const SelectAllIntent(),
        ),
        child: const Text('SELECT ALL'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

This logs every action as it executes, like so:

```
flutter: Action invoked: SelectAllAction#906fc(SelectAllIntent#a98e3) from Builder(dependencies: _[ActionsMarker])
```

content\_copy

## Putting it together

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/actions-and-shortcuts#putting-it-together)

The combination of `Actions` and `Shortcuts` is powerful: you can define generic
intents that map to specific actions at the widget level. Here's a simple app
that illustrates the concepts described above. The app creates a text field that
also has "select all" and "copy to clipboard" buttons next to it. The buttons
invoke actions to accomplish their work. All the invoked actions and
shortcuts are logged.

[vertical\_align\_topGuide to app architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

The following pages demonstrate how to build an app using best practices.
The recommendations in this guide can be applied to most apps,
making them easier to scale, test, and maintain.
However, they're guidelines, not steadfast rules,
and you should adapt them to your unique requirements.


This section provides a high-level overview of how Flutter applications can be
architected. It explains the layers of an application,
along with the classes that exist within each layer.
The section after this provides concrete code samples and
walks through a Flutter application that's implemented these recommendations.


## Overview of project structure

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#overview-of-project-structure)

[Separation-of-concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) is the most important principle to follow when
designing your Flutter app.
Your Flutter application should split into two broad layers,
the UI layer and the Data layer.


Each layer is further split into different components,
each of which has distinct responsibilities, a well-defined interface,
boundaries and dependencies.
This guide recommends you split your application into the following components:


- Views
- View models
- Repositories
- Services

### MVVM

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#mvvm)

If you've encountered the [Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)
(MVVM),
this will be familiar.
MVVM is an architectural pattern that separates a
feature of an application into three parts:
the `Model`, the `ViewModel` and the `View`.
Views and view models make up the UI layer of an application.
Repositories and services represent the data of an application,
or the model layer of MVVM.
Each of these components is defined in the next section.


![MVVM architectural pattern](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/mvvm-intro-with-layers.png)

Every feature in an application will contain one view to describe the UI and
one view model to handle logic,
one or more repositories as the sources of truth for your application data,
and zero or more services that interact with external APIs,
like client servers and platform plugins.


A single feature of an application might require all of the following objects:

![An example of the Dart objects that might exist in one feature using the architecture described on page.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-example.png)

Each of these objects and the arrows that connect them will be explained
thoroughly by the end of this page. Throughout this guide,
the following simplified version of that diagram will be used as an anchor.


![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified.png)

## UI layer

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#ui-layer)

An application's UI layer is responsible for interacting with the user.
It displays an application's data to the user and receives user input,
such as tap events and form inputs.


The UI reacts to data changes or user input.
When the UI receives new data from a Repository,
it should re-render to display that new data.
When the user interacts with the UI,
it should change to reflect that interaction.


The UI layer is made up of two architectural components,
based on the MVVM design pattern:


- **Views** describe how to present application data to the user.
Specifically, they refer to _compositions of widgets_ that make a feature.
For instance, a view is often (but not always) a screen that
has a `Scaffold` widget, along with
all of the widgets below it in the widget tree.
Views are also responsible for passing events to
the view model in response to user interactions.

- **View models** contain the logic that converts app data into _UI State_,
because data from repositories is often formatted differently from
the data that needs to be displayed.
For example, you might need to combine data from multiple repositories,
or you might want to filter a list of data records.


Views and view models should have a one-to-one relationship.

![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page with the view and view model objects highlighted.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified-UI-highlighted.png)

In the simplest terms,
a view model manages the UI state and the view displays that state.
Using views and view models, your UI layer can maintain state during
configuration changes (such as screen rotations),
and you can test the logic of your UI independently of Flutter widgets.


A feature of an application is user centric,
and therefore defined by the UI layer.
Every instance of a paired _view_ and _view model_ defines one feature in your app.
This is often a screen in your app, but it doesn't have to be.
For example, consider logging in and out.
Logging in is generally done on a specific screen whose
only purpose is to provide the user with a way to log in.
In the application code, the login screen would be
made up of a `LoginViewModel` class and a `LoginView` class.


On the other hand,
logging out of an app is generally not done on a dedicated screen.
The ability to log out is generally presented to the user as a button in
a menu, a user account screen, or any number of different locations.
It's often presented in multiple locations.
In such scenarios, you might have a `LogoutViewModel` and a `LogoutView`
which
only contains a single button that can be dropped into other widgets.


### Views

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#views)

In Flutter, views are the widget classes of your application.
Views are the primary method of rendering UI,
and shouldn't contain any business logic.
They should be passed all data they need to render from the view model.


![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page with the view object highlighted.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified-View-highlighted.png)

The only logic a view should contain is:

- Simple if-statements to show and hide widgets based on a flag or nullable
field in the view model

- Animation logic
- Layout logic based on device information, like screen size or orientation.
- Simple routing logic

All logic related to data should be handled in the view model.

### View models

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#view-models)

A view model exposes the application data necessary to render a view.
In the architecture design described on this page,
most of the logic in your Flutter application lives in view models.


![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page with the view model object highlighted.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified-ViewModel-highlighted.png)

A view model's main responsibilities include:

- Retrieving application data from repositories and transforming it into a
format suitable for presentation in the view.
For example, it might filter, sort or aggregate data.

- Maintaining the current state needed in the view,
so that the view can rebuild without losing data.
For example, it might contain boolean flags to
conditionally render widgets in the view, or a field that
tracks which section of a carousel is active on screen.

- Exposes callbacks (called **commands**) to the view that can be
attached to an event handler, like a button press or form submission.


Commands are named for the [command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern),
and are Dart functions that allow views to
execute complex logic without knowledge of its implementation.
Commands are written as members of the view model class to
be called by the gesture handlers in the view class.


You can find examples of views, view models, and commands on
the [UI layer](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/case-study/ui-layer) portion of the [App architecture case study](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/case-study).


For a gentle introduction to MVVM in Flutter,
check out the [state management fundamentals](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/intro).


## Data layer

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#data-layer)

The data layer of an app handles your business data and logic.
Two pieces of architecture make up the data layer: services and repositories.
These pieces should have well-defined inputs and outputs
to simplify their reusability and testability.


![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page with the Data layer highlighted.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified-Data-highlighted.png)

Using MVVM language, services and repositories make up your _model layer_.

### Repositories

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#repositories)

[Repository](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) classes are the source of truth for your model data.
They're responsible for polling data from services,
and transforming that raw data into **domain models**.
Domain models represent the data that the application needs,
formatted in a way that your view model classes can consume.
There should be a repository class for
each different type of data handled in your app.


Repositories handle the business logic associated with services, such as:

- Caching
- Error handling
- Retry logic
- Refreshing data
- Polling services for new data
- Refreshing data based on user actions

![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page with the Repository object highlighted.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified-Repository-highlighted.png)

Repositories output application data as domain models.
For example, a social media app might have a
`UserProfileRepository` class that exposes a `Stream<UserProfile?>`,
which emits a new value whenever the user signs in or out.


The models output by repositories are consumed by view models.
Repositories and view models have a many-to-many relationship.
A view model can use many repositories to get the data it needs,
and a repository can be used by many view models.


Repositories should never be aware of each other.
If your application has business logic that needs data from two repositories,
you should combine the data in the view model or in the domain layer,
especially if your repository-to-view-model relationship is complex.


### Services

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#services)

Services are in the lowest layer of your application.
They wrap API endpoints and expose asynchronous response objects,
such as `Future` and `Stream` objects.
They're only used to isolate data-loading, and they hold no state.
Your app should have one service class per data source.
Examples of endpoints that services might wrap include:


- The underlying platform, like iOS and Android APIs
- REST endpoints
- Local files

As a rule of thumb, services are most helpful when
the necessary data lives outside of your application's Dart code -
which is true of each of the preceding examples.


Services and repositories have a many-to-many relationship.
A single Repository can use several services,
and a service can be used by multiple repositories.


![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page with the Service object highlighted.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified-Service-highlighted.png)

## Optional: Domain layer

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#optional-domain-layer)

As your app grows and adds features, you may need to abstract away logic that
adds too much complexity to your view models.
These classes are often called interactors or **use-cases**.


Use-cases are responsible for making interactions between
the UI and Data layers simpler and more reusable.
They take data from repositories and make it suitable for the UI layer.


![MVVM design pattern with an added domain layer object](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/mvvm-intro-with-domain-layer.png)

Use-cases are primarily used to encapsulate business logic that would otherwise
live in the view model and meets one or more of the following conditions:


1. Requires merging data from multiple repositories
2. Is exceedingly complex
3. The logic will be reused by different view models

This layer is optional because not all applications or features within an
application have these requirements.
If you suspect your application would
benefit from this additional layer, consider the pros and cons:


| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ Avoid code duplication in view models | ❌ Increases complexity of your architecture, adding more classes and higher cognitive load |
| ✅ Improve testability by separating complex business logic from UI logic | ❌ Testing requires additional mocks |
| ✅ Improve code readability in view models | ❌ Adds additional boilerplate to your code |

### Data access with use-cases

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide#data-access-with-use-cases)

Another consideration when adding a Domain layer is whether view models will
continue to have access to repository data directly, or if you'll enforce
view models to go through use-cases to get their data. Put another way,
will you add use-cases as you need them?
Perhaps when you notice repeated logic in your view models?
Or, will you create a use-case each time a view model needs data,
even if the logic in the use-case is simple?


If you choose to do the latter,
it intensifies the earlier outlined pros and cons.
Your application code will be extremely modular and testable,
but it also adds a significant amount of unnecessary overhead.


A good approach is to add use-cases only when needed.
If you find that your view models are
accessing data through use-cases most of the time,
you can always refactor your code to utilize use-cases exclusively.
The example app used later in this guide has use-cases for some features,
but also has view models that interact with repositories directly.
A complex feature may ultimately end up looking like this:


![A simplified diagram of the architecture described on this page with a use case object.](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/guide/feature-architecture-simplified-with-logic-layer.png)

This method of adding use-cases is defined by the following rules:

- Use-cases depend on repositories
- Use-cases and repositories have a many-to-many relationship
- View models depend on one or more use-cases _and_ one or more repositories

This method of using use-cases ends up looking
less like a layered lasagna, and more like a plated dinner with
two mains (UI and data layers) and a side (domain layer).
Use-cases are just utility classes that have well-defined inputs and outputs.
This approach is flexible and extendable,
but it requires greater diligence to maintain order.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

## Summary

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#summary)

To build a Flutter app for Android, Flutter's Gradle plugins must be applied.
Historically, this was done imperatively with Gradle's
[legacy, imperative apply script method](https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/plugins.html#sec:script_plugins).


In Flutter 3.16, support was added for applying these plugins with Gradle's
[declarative plugins {} block](https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block)
(also called the Plugin DSL) and it is
now the recommended approach. Since Flutter 3.16, projects generated with
`flutter create` use the Plugin DSL to apply Gradle plugins. Projects created
with versions of Flutter prior to 3.16 need to be migrated manually.


Applying Gradle plugins using the `plugins {}` block executes the same code as
before and should produce equivalent app binaries.


To learn about advantages the new Plugin DSL syntax has over the legacy `apply`
script syntax, see [Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#plugins_dsl_limitations).


Migrating the app ecosystem to use the new approach will also make it easier for
Flutter team to develop Flutter's Gradle plugins, and to enable exciting new
features in the future, such as using Kotlin instead of Groovy in Gradle
buildscripts.


## Migrate

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#migrate)

### android/settings.gradle

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#androidsettings-gradle)

First, find the values of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)
and Kotlin that the project currently uses.
Unless they have been moved,
they are likely defined in the buildscript block of the
`<app-src>/android/build.gradle` file.
As an example, consider the `build.gradle` file from
a new Flutter app created before this change:


groovy

```
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
​
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
​
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
​
rootProject.buildDir = '../build'
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = "${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}"
}
subprojects {
    project.evaluationDependsOn(':app')
}
​
tasks.register("clean", Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```

content\_copy

The AGP version is the number that comes at the end of the line
`classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'`, so `7.3.0`

in this case. Similarly, the Kotlin version comes at the end of the line
`ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'`, in this case `1.7.10`.


Next, replace the contents of
`<app-src>/android/settings.gradle` with the following,
remembering to replace `{agpVersion}` and `{kotlinVersion}` with previously
identified values:


groovy

```
pluginManagement {
    def flutterSdkPath = {
        def properties = new Properties()
        file("local.properties").withInputStream { properties.load(it) }
        def flutterSdkPath = properties.getProperty("flutter.sdk")
        assert flutterSdkPath != null, "flutter.sdk not set in local.properties"
        return flutterSdkPath
    }()
​
    includeBuild("$flutterSdkPath/packages/flutter_tools/gradle")
​
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
​
plugins {
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0" // apply true
    id "com.android.application" version "{agpVersion}" apply false
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "{kotlinVersion}" apply false
}
​
include ":app"
```

content\_copy

If you made some changes to this file, make sure they're placed after
`pluginManagement {}` and `plugins {}` blocks, since Gradle enforces
that no other code can be placed before these blocks.


The settings Flutter Gradle Plugin (`dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader`)
should not have apply false (the default is true) or should be explicitly
set to true.


### android/build.gradle

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#androidbuild-gradle)

Remove the whole `buildscript` block from `<app-src/android/build.gradle`:

groovy

```
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '{kotlinVersion}'
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
​
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
```

content\_copy

Here's how that file will likely end up:

groovy

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
​
rootProject.buildDir = '../build'
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = "${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}"
}
subprojects {
    project.evaluationDependsOn(':app')
}
​
tasks.register("clean", Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```

content\_copy

### android/app/build.gradle

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#androidappbuild-gradle)

The following changes to code that is, by default
found in `<app-src>/android/app/build.gradle`, also need to be made.
First, remove the following 2 chunks of code that use the
legacy imperative apply method:


groovy

```
def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw new GradleException("Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.")
}
```

content\_copy

groovy

```
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.jetbrains.kotlin.android'
apply from: "$flutterRoot/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle"
```

content\_copy

Now apply the plugins again,
but this time using the Plugin DSL syntax.
At the very top of your file, add:


groovy

```
plugins {
    id "com.android.application"
    id "kotlin-android"
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin"
}
```

content\_copy

`"dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin"` is the project Flutter
Gradle Plugin, which is a different string than the value applied
in settings.gradle(.kts) (`"dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader"`).


Finally, if your `dependencies` block contains a dependency
on `"org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:$kotlin_version"`,
then remove that dependency.


groovy

```
dependencies {
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:$kotlin_version"
}
```

content\_copy

If it was the only dependency in the `dependencies` block,
then you can instead remove the block entirely.


### Validation

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#validation)

Execute `flutter run` to confirm that your app builds and
launches on a connected Android device or emulator.


## Examples

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#examples)

### Google Mobile Services and Crashlytics

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply#google-mobile-services-and-crashlytics)

If your app was using Google Mobile Services and Crashlytics,
remove the following lines from `<app-src>/android/build.gradle`:


groovy

```
buildscript {
    // ...
​
    dependencies {
        // ...
        classpath "com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0"
        classpath "com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.9.9"
    }
}
```

content\_copy

Then remove these 2 lines from `<app-src>/android/app/build.gradle`:

groovy

```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
```

content\_copy

To migrate to the new, declarative-apply syntax for
the GMS and Crashlytics plugins, add them to `plugins` block
in your app's `<app-src>/android/settings.gradle` file.
The additions should look similar to the following,
but with your desired plugin versions, likely matching
the ones you removed from the `<app-src>/android/build.gradle` file.


groovy

```
plugins {
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0"
    id "com.android.application" version "{agpVersion}" apply false
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "{kotlinVersion}" apply false
    id "com.google.gms.google-services" version "4.4.0" apply false
    id "com.google.firebase.crashlytics" version "2.9.9" apply false
}
```

content\_copy

Add the following lines to `<app-src>/android/app/build.gradle`:

groovy

```
plugins {
    id "com.android.application"
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin"
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android"
    id "com.google.gms.google-services"
    id "com.google.firebase.crashlytics"
}
```

content\_copy

[vertical\_align\_topPlace a floating app bar above a list](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This guide describes how to place a floating app bar or
navigation bar above a list in a Flutter app.


## Overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#overview)

To make it easier for users to view a list of items,
you might want to minimize the app bar (navigation bar), as
the user scrolls down the list.


Moving the app bar into a [`CustomScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomScrollView-class.html)
allows you
to create an app bar that can be minimized or scroll
offscreen as you scroll through a list of items contained
inside the `CustomScrollView`.


This recipe demonstrates how to use a `CustomScrollView` to
display a list of items with an app bar on top that
minimizes as the user scrolls down the list using the
following steps:


1. Create a `CustomScrollView`.
2. Add a floating app bar to `CustomScrollView`.
3. Add a list of items to `CustomScrollView`.

## 1\. Create a `CustomScrollView`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#1-create-a-customscrollview)

To create a floating app bar, place the app bar inside a
`CustomScrollView` that also contains the list of items.
This synchronizes the scroll position of the app bar and the
list of items. You might think of the `CustomScrollView`
widget as a `ListView` that allows you to mix and match
different types of scrollable lists and widgets together.


The scrollable lists and widgets provided to the
`CustomScrollView` are known as _slivers_. There are several
types of slivers, such as `SliverList`, `SliverGrid`, and
`SliverAppBar`. In fact, the `ListView` and `GridView`

widgets use the `SliverList` and `SliverGrid` widgets to
implement scrolling.


For this example, create a `CustomScrollView` that contains
a `SliverList`. Also, remove the app bar property from your
code if it exists.


- [Material widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#127-tab-panel)
- [Cupertino widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#128-tab-panel)

dart

```
MaterialApp(
  title: 'Floating App Bar',
  home: Scaffold(
    // No app bar property provided yet.
    body: CustomScrollView(
      // Add the app bar and list of items as slivers in the next steps.
      slivers: <Widget>[],
    ),
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

dart

```
CupertinoApp(
  title: 'Floating Navigation Bar',
  home: CupertinoPageScaffold(
    // No navigation bar property provided yet.
    child: CustomScrollView(
      // Add the navigation bar and list of items as slivers in the next steps.
      slivers: <Widget>[],
    ),
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

## 2\. Add a floating app bar

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#2-add-a-floating-app-bar)

Next, add an app bar to the [`CustomScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomScrollView-class.html).


- [Material widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#129-tab-panel)
- [Cupertino widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#130-tab-panel)

Flutter provides the [`SliverAppBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SliverAppBar-class.html)
widget which,
much like the normal `AppBar` widget,
uses the `SliverAppBar` to display a title,
tabs, images and more.


However, the `SliverAppBar` also gives you the ability to
create a "floating" app bar that shrinks and floats when
you're not at the top of the page.


To create this effect:

1. Start with an app bar that displays only a title.
2. Set the `pinned` property to `true`.
3. Add a `flexibleSpace` widget that fills the available
    `expandedHeight`.


dart

```
slivers: [\
  // Add the app bar to the CustomScrollView.\
  SliverAppBar(\
    // Provide a standard title.\
    title: Text('Floating App Bar'),\
    // Pin the app bar when scrolling.\
    pinned: true,\
    // Display a placeholder widget to visualize the shrinking size.\
    flexibleSpace: Placeholder(),\
    // Make the initial height of the SliverAppBar larger than normal.\
    expandedHeight: 200,\
  ),\
],
```

content\_copy

Flutter provides the [`CupertinoSliverNavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoSliverNavigationBar-class.html)

widget, which lets you have a "floating" navigation
bar that shrinks when you scroll down and floats when
you're not at the top of the page.


To create this effect:

1. Add `CupertinoSliverNavigationBar` to
    `CustomScrollView`.

2. Start with an app bar that displays only a title.

dart

```
slivers: [\
  // Add the navigation bar to the CustomScrollView.\
  CupertinoSliverNavigationBar(\
    // Provide a standard title.\
    largeTitle: Text('Floating App Bar'),\
  ),\
],
```

content\_copy

## 3\. Add a list of items

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#3-add-a-list-of-items)

Now that you have the app bar in place, add a list of items
to the `CustomScrollView`. You have two options: a
[`SliverList`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverList-class.html)
or a [`SliverGrid`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverGrid-class.html). If you need to
display a list of items one after the other, use the
`SliverList` widget. If you need to display a grid list, use
the `SliverGrid` widget.


- [Material widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#131-tab-panel)
- [Cupertino widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/lists/floating-app-bar#132-tab-panel)

dart

```
// Next, create a SliverList
SliverList.builder(
  // The builder function returns a ListTile with a title that
  // displays the index of the current item.
  itemBuilder: (context, index) =>
      ListTile(title: Text('Item #$index')),
  // Builds 50 ListTiles
  itemCount: 50,
)
```

content\_copy

dart

```
// Next, create a SliverList
SliverList.builder(
  // The builder function returns a CupertinoListTile with a title
  // that displays the index of the current item.
  itemBuilder: (context, index) =>
      CupertinoListTile(title: Text('Item #$index')),
  // Builds 50 CupertinoListTile
  itemCount: 50,
)
```

[vertical\_align\_topSet up iOS development](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/setup#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Learn how to set up your development environment
to run, build, and deploy Flutter apps for iOS devices.


## Set up iOS tooling

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/setup#set-up-tooling)

With Xcode, you can run Flutter apps on
an iOS physical device or on the iOS Simulator.


1. ### Install Xcode


If you haven't done so already,
    [install and set up the latest version of Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

If you've already installed Xcode,
    update it to the latest version using the
    same installation method you used originally.

2. ### Set up Xcode command-line tools


To configure the Xcode command-line tools to use
    the version of Xcode you installed,
    run the following command in your preferred terminal:





```
$ sudo sh -c 'xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer && xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch'
```

content\_copy



If you downloaded Xcode elsewhere or need to use a different version,
    replace `/Applications/Xcode.app` with the path to there instead.

3. ### Agree to the Xcode licenses


After you've set up Xcode and configured its command-line tools,
    agree to the Xcode licenses.
1. Open your preferred terminal.

2. Run the following command to review and sign the Xcode licenses.





      ```
      $ sudo xcodebuild -license
      ```

      content\_copy

3. Read and agree to all necessary licenses.

      Before agreeing to the terms of each license,
       read each with care.
4. ### Download prerequisite tooling


To download iOS platform support and
    the latest iOS Simulator runtimes,
    run the following command in your preferred terminal.





```
$ xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS
```

content\_copy

5. ### Install Rosetta


If you're developing on an [Apple Silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943) (ARM) Mac,
    [install Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527):





```
$ sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

content\_copy

6. ### Install CocoaPods


To support [Flutter plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#types) that use native iOS or macOS code,
    install the latest version of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation).

Install CocoaPods by following the
    [CocoaPods installation guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation).

If you've already installed CocoaPods,
    update it by following the [CocoaPods update guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#updating-cocoapods).


## Set up an iOS device

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/setup#set-up-devices)

We recommend starting with the iOS Simulator as
it's easier to get set up than a physical iOS device.
However, you should also test your app on an actual
physical device.


- [Simulator](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/setup#170-tab-panel)
- [Physical device](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/setup#171-tab-panel)

Start the iOS Simulator with the following command:

```
$ open -a Simulator
```

content\_copy

If you need to install a simulator for a different OS version,
check out [Downloading and installing additional Xcode components](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/downloading-and-installing-additional-xcode-components)

on the Apple Developer site.


Set up each iOS device on which you want to test.

1. ### Configure your physical iOS device

1. Attach your iOS device to the USB port on your Mac.

2. On first connecting an iOS device to your Mac,
       your device displays the **Trust this computer?** dialog.

3. Click **Trust**.

      ![Trust Mac](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/setup/trust-computer.png)
2. ### Configure your physical iOS device


Apple requires enabling **[Developer Mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device)**

    on the device to protect against malicious software.
1. Tap on **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**.

2. Tap to toggle **Developer Mode** to **On**.

3. Restart the device.

4. When the **Turn on Developer Mode?** dialog appears,
       tap **Turn On**.
3. ### Create a developer code signing certificate


To send your app to a physical iOS device,
    _even_ for testing, you must establish trust
    between your Mac and the device.
    In addition to trusting the device when that
    popup appears, you must upload a signed
    developer certificate to your device.

To create a signed development certificate,
    you need an Apple ID.
    If you don't have one, [create one](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108647).
    You must also enroll in the [Apple Developer program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)

    and create an [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account).
    If you're just _testing_ your app on an iOS device,
    a personal Apple Developer account is free and works.

4. ### Prepare the device

1. Find the **VPN & Device Management** menu under **Settings**.

      Toggle your certificate to **Enable**.

2. Under the **Developer App** heading,
       you should find your certificate.

3. Tap the certificate.

4. Tap **Trust "<certificate>"**.

5. When the dialog displays, tap **Trust**.

      If the **codesign wants to access key...** dialog appears:

      1. Enter your macOS password.

      2. Tap **Always Allow**.

With Flutter's [animation library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/animation-library.html),
you can add motion and create visual effects
for the widgets in your UI.
One part of the library is an assortment of widgets
that manage animations for you.
These widgets are collectively referred to as _implicit animations_,
or _implicitly animated widgets_, deriving their name from the
[`ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget-class.html)
class that they implement.
The following set of resources provide many ways to learn
about implicit animations in Flutter.

Architecture is an important part of building a
maintainable, resilient, and scalable Flutter app.
In this guide, you'll learn app architecture principles and
best practices for building Flutter apps.

'Architecture' is a word that's hard to define.
It's a broad term and can refer to any number
of topics depending on the context. In this guide,
'architecture' refers to how to structure, organize, and design
your Flutter app in order to scale as your project requirements and team grow.

![Hero image](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-architecture/hero-image.png)

## What you'll learn

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture#what-youll-learn)

- Benefits of intentional architecture
- Common architectural principles
- The Flutter team's recommended app architecture
- MVVM and state management
- Dependency injection
- Common design patterns for writing robust Flutter applications

## Benefits of intentional architecture

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture#benefits-of-intentional-architecture)

Good app architecture provides a number of benefits to
engineering teams and their end users.


- Maintainability - App architecture makes it easier to modify, update, and fix
issues over time.

- Scalability - A well thought out application allows more people to contribute
to the same codebase concurrently, with minimal code conflicts.

- Testability - Applications with intentional architecture generally have
simpler classes with well-defined inputs and outputs, which makes them easier
to mock and test.

- Lower cognitive load - Developers who are new to the project will be more
productive in a shorter amount of time, and code reviews are generally less
time-consuming when code is easier to understand.

- A better user experience - Features can ship faster and with fewer bugs.

## How to use this guide

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture#how-to-use-this-guide)

This is a guide for building scalable Flutter applications and was written for
teams that have multiple developers contributing to the same code base,
who're building a feature-rich application.
If you're writing a Flutter app that has a _growing team and codebase_,
this guidance is for you.


Along with general architectural advice, this guide gives concrete examples of
best practices and includes specific recommendations.
Some libraries can be swapped out, and very large teams with unique complexity
might find that some parts don't apply.
In either case, the ideas remain sound.
This is the recommended way to build a Flutter app.


In the first part of this guide, you'll learn about common architectural
principles from a high level. In the second part,
the guide walks through specific and
concrete recommendations of architecting Flutter apps.
Finally, at the end of the guide, you'll find a list of design patterns and
sample code that shows the recommendations in action.

listOn this pagechevron\_rightPlatform idioms

[vertical\_align\_topPlatform idioms](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

The final area to consider for adaptive apps is platform standards.
Each platform has its own idioms and norms;
these nominal or de facto standards inform user expectations
of how an application should behave. Thanks, in part to the web,
users are accustomed to more customized experiences,
but reflecting these platform standards can still provide
significant benefits:


- **Reduce cognitive load**

By matching the user's existing mental model,
accomplishing tasks becomes intuitive,
which requires less thinking,
boosts productivity, and reduces frustrations.


- **Build trust**

Users can become wary or suspicious
when applications don't adhere to their expectations.
Conversely, a UI that feels familiar can build user trust
and can help improve the perception of quality.
This often has the added benefit of better app store
ratings—something we can all appreciate!


## Consider expected behavior on each platform

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#consider-expected-behavior-on-each-platform)

The first step is to spend some time considering what
the expected appearance, presentation,
or behavior is on this platform.
Try to forget any limitations of your current implementation,
and just envision the ideal user experience.
Work backwards from there.


Another way to think about this is to ask,
"How would a user of this platform expect to achieve this goal?"
Then, try to envision how that would work in your app
without any compromises.


This can be difficult if you aren't a regular user of the platform.
You might be unaware of the specific idioms and can easily miss
them completely. For example, a lifetime Android user is
likely unaware of platform conventions on iOS,
and the same holds true for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
These differences might be subtle to you,
but be painfully obvious to an experienced user.


### Find a platform advocate

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#find-a-platform-advocate)

If possible, assign someone as an advocate for each platform.
Ideally, your advocate uses the platform as their primary device,
and can offer the perspective of a highly opinionated user.
To reduce the number of people, combine roles.
Have one advocate for Windows and Android,
one for Linux and the web, and one for Mac and iOS.


The goal is to have constant, informed feedback so the app
feels great on each platform. Advocates should be encouraged
to be quite picky, calling out anything they feel differs from
typical applications on their device. A simple example is how
the default button in a dialog is typically on the left on Mac
and Linux, but is on the right on Windows.
Details like that are easy to miss if you aren't using a platform
on a regular basis.


### Stay unique

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#stay-unique)

Conforming to expected behaviors doesn't mean that your app
needs to use default components or styling.
Many of the most popular multiplatform apps have very distinct
and opinionated UIs including custom buttons, context menus,
and title bars.


The more you can consolidate styling and behavior across platforms,
the easier development and testing will be.
The trick is to balance creating a unique experience with a
strong identity, while respecting the norms of each platform.


## Common idioms and norms to consider

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#common-idioms-and-norms-to-consider)

Take a quick look at a few specific norms and idioms
you might want to consider, and how you could approach
them in Flutter.


### Scrollbar appearance and behavior

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#scrollbar-appearance-and-behavior)

Desktop and mobile users expect scrollbars,
but they expect them to behave differently on different platforms.
Mobile users expect smaller scrollbars that only appear
while scrolling, whereas desktop users generally expect
omnipresent, larger scrollbars that they can click or drag.


Flutter comes with a built-in `Scrollbar` widget that already
has support for adaptive colors and sizes according to the
current platform. The one tweak you might want to make is to
toggle `alwaysShown` when on a desktop platform:


dart

```
return Scrollbar(
  thumbVisibility: DeviceType.isDesktop,
  controller: _scrollController,
  child: GridView.count(
    controller: _scrollController,
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(Insets.extraLarge),
    childAspectRatio: 1,
    crossAxisCount: colCount,
    children: listChildren,
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

This subtle attention to detail can make your app feel more
comfortable on a given platform.


### Multi-select

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#multi-select)

Dealing with multi-select within a list is another area
with subtle differences across platforms:


dart

```
static bool get isSpanSelectModifierDown =>
    isKeyDown({LogicalKeyboardKey.shiftLeft, LogicalKeyboardKey.shiftRight});
```

content\_copy

To perform a platform-aware check for control or command,
you can write something like this:


dart

```
static bool get isMultiSelectModifierDown {
  bool isDown = false;
  if (Platform.isMacOS) {
    isDown = isKeyDown({
      LogicalKeyboardKey.metaLeft,
      LogicalKeyboardKey.metaRight,
    });
  } else {
    isDown = isKeyDown({
      LogicalKeyboardKey.controlLeft,
      LogicalKeyboardKey.controlRight,
    });
  }
  return isDown;
}
```

content\_copy

A final consideration for keyboard users is the **Select All** action.
If you have a large list of items of selectable items,
many of your keyboard users will expect that they can use
`Control+A` to select all the items.


#### Touch devices

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#touch-devices)

On touch devices, multi-selection is typically simplified,
with the expected behavior being similar to having the
`isMultiSelectModifier` down on the desktop.
You can select or deselect items using a single tap,
and will usually have a button to **Select All** or
**Clear** the current selection.


How you handle multi-selection on different devices depends
on your specific use cases, but the important thing is to
make sure that you're offering each platform the best
interaction model possible.


### Selectable text

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#selectable-text)

A common expectation on the web (and to a lesser extent desktop)
is that most visible text can be selected with the mouse cursor.
When text is not selectable,
users on the web tend to have an adverse reaction.


Luckily, this is easy to support with the [`SelectableText`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SelectableText-class.html)
widget:


dart

```
return const SelectableText('Select me!');
```

content\_copy

To support rich text, then use `TextSpan`:

dart

```
return const SelectableText.rich(
  TextSpan(
    children: [\
      TextSpan(text: 'Hello'),\
      TextSpan(\
        text: 'Bold',\
        style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),\
      ),\
    ],
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

### Title bars

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#title-bars)

On modern desktop applications, it's common to customize
the title bar of your app window, adding a logo for
stronger branding or contextual controls to help save
vertical space in your main UI.


![Samples of title bars](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/titlebar.png)

This isn't supported directly in Flutter, but you can use the
[`bits_dojo`](https://github.com/bitsdojo/bitsdojo_window) package to disable the native title bars,
and replace them with your own.


This package lets you add whatever widgets you want to the
`TitleBar` because it uses pure Flutter widgets under the hood.
This makes it easy to adapt the title bar as you navigate
to different sections of the app.


### Context menus and tooltips

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#context-menus-and-tooltips)

On desktop, there are several interactions that
manifest as a widget shown in an overlay,
but with differences in how they're triggered, dismissed,
and positioned:


- **Context menu**

Typically triggered by a right-click,
a context menu is positioned close to the mouse,
and is dismissed by clicking anywhere,
selecting an option from the menu, or clicking outside it.


- **Tooltip**

Typically triggered by hovering for
200-400ms over an interactive element,
a tooltip is usually anchored to a widget
(as opposed to the mouse position) and is dismissed
when the mouse cursor leaves that widget.


- **Popup panel (also known as flyout)**

Similar to a tooltip,
a popup panel is usually anchored to a widget.
The main difference is that panels are most often
shown on a tap event, and they usually don't hide
themselves when the cursor leaves.
Instead, panels are typically dismissed by clicking
outside the panel or by pressing a **Close** or **Submit**
button.


To show basic tooltips in Flutter,
use the built-in [`Tooltip`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Tooltip-class.html)
widget:


dart

```
return const Tooltip(
  message: 'I am a Tooltip',
  child: Text('Hover over the text to show a tooltip.'),
);
```

content\_copy

Flutter also provides built-in context menus when editing
or selecting text.


To show more advanced tooltips, popup panels,
or create custom context menus,
you either use one of the available packages,
or build it yourself using a `Stack` or `Overlay`.


Some available packages include:

- [`context_menus`](https://pub.dev/packages/context_menus)
- [`anchored_popups`](https://pub.dev/packages/anchored_popups)
- [`flutter_portal`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_portal)
- [`super_tooltip`](https://pub.dev/packages/super_tooltip)
- [`custom_pop_up_menu`](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_pop_up_menu)

While these controls can be valuable for touch users as accelerators,
they are essential for mouse users. These users expect
to right-click things, edit content in place,
and hover for more information. Failing to meet those expectations
can lead to disappointed users, or at least,
a feeling that something isn't quite right.


### Horizontal button order

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#horizontal-button-order)

On Windows, when presenting a row of buttons,
the confirmation button is placed at the start of
the row (left side). On all other platforms,
it's the opposite. The confirmation button is
placed at the end of the row (right side).


This can be easily handled in Flutter using the
`TextDirection` property on `Row`:


dart

```
TextDirection btnDirection = DeviceType.isWindows
    ? TextDirection.rtl
    : TextDirection.ltr;
return Row(
  children: [\
    const Spacer(),\
    Row(\
      textDirection: btnDirection,\
      children: [\
        DialogButton(\
          label: 'Cancel',\
          onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context, false),\
        ),\
        DialogButton(\
          label: 'Ok',\
          onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context, true),\
        ),\
      ],\
    ),\
  ],
);
```

![Sample of embedded image](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/embed_image2.png)

### Menu bar

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#menu-bar)

Another common pattern on desktop apps is the menu bar.
On Windows and Linux, this menu lives as part of the Chrome title bar,
whereas on macOS, it's located along the top of the primary screen.


Currently, you can specify custom menu bar entries using
a prototype plugin, but it's expected that this functionality will
eventually be integrated into the main SDK.


It's worth mentioning that on Windows and Linux,
you can't combine a custom title bar with a menu bar.
When you create a custom title bar,
you're replacing the native one completely,
which means you also lose the integrated native menu bar.


If you need both a custom title bar and a menu bar,
you can achieve that by implementing it in Flutter,
similar to a custom context menu.


### Drag and drop

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/idioms#drag-and-drop)

One of the core interactions for both touch-based and
pointer-based inputs is drag and drop. Although this
interaction is expected for both types of input,
there are important differences to think about when
it comes to scrolling lists of draggable items.


Generally speaking, touch users expect to see drag handles
to differentiate draggable areas from scrollable ones,
or alternatively, to initiate a drag by using a long
press gesture. This is because scrolling and dragging
are both sharing a single finger for input.


Mouse users have more input options. They can use a wheel
or scrollbar to scroll, which generally eliminates the need
for dedicated drag handles. If you look at the macOS
Finder or Windows Explorer, you'll see that they work
this way: you just select an item and start dragging.


In Flutter, you can implement drag and drop in many ways.
Discussing specific implementations is outside
the scope of this article, but some high level options
include the following:


- Use the [`Draggable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Draggable-class.html)
and [`DragTarget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DragTarget-class.html)
APIs
directly for a custom look and feel.

- Hook into `onPan` gesture events,
and move an object yourself within a parent `Stack`.

- Use one of the [pre-made list packages](https://pub.dev/packages?q=reorderable+list) on pub.dev.

[vertical\_align\_topBuild for and integrate with multiple platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Flutter enables you to build, test, and deploy beautiful, natively compiled,
multi-platform applications from a single codebase.


## Overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration#overview)

Flutter and its core packages often automatically support and integrate
with Flutter's officially [supported platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms).
Some platforms require you to [set up additional tooling](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration#setup),
but once your development environment is set up,
Flutter apps are usually functional across platforms out of the box.


Occasionally you need to integrate with platform-specific functionality.
For example, you might want to use a native library that's
only available on iOS and iPadOS.
For many use cases, you can find and use one of the many [Flutter plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages)

provided by the Flutter team and the amazing Flutter community.
If none of them meet your needs, you can
[write platform-specific code](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels)
and even [create your own plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages).


## Set up platform development

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration#setup)

While Flutter apps can be built for a variety of [supported platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms)

with little to no modifications to your code,
your development environment might require additional setup
when targeting a new platform.


To set up development for an additional platform,
select the platform from the following:


[Target AndroidOn any device\\
\\
Set up your development environment to build Flutter apps for Android.](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/android/setup) [Target iOSOn macOS only\\
\\
Set up your development environment to build Flutter apps for iOS.](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/setup) [Target WebOn any device\\

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

State management is a complex topic.
If you feel that some of your questions haven't been answered,
or that the approach described on these pages
is not viable for your use cases, you are probably right.


Learn more from the following resources,
many of which have been contributed by the Flutter community.


## General overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#general-overview)

Things to review before selecting an approach.

- [Introduction to state management](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/intro),
which is the beginning of this very section
(for those of you who arrived directly to this _Options_ page
and missed the previous pages)

- [Pragmatic State Management in Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_m5csmrf7I),
a video from Google I/O 2019

- [Flutter Architecture Samples](https://fluttersamples.com/), by Brian Egan

## Built-in approaches

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#built-in-approaches)

### `setState`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#setstate)

The low-level approach to use for widget-specific, ephemeral state.

- [Adding interactivity to your Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity), a Flutter tutorial
- [Basic state management in Google Flutter](https://medium.com/@agungsurya/basic-state-management-in-google-flutter-6ee73608f96d), by Agung Surya


### `ValueNotifier` and `InheritedNotifier`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#valuenotifier-and-inheritednotifier)

An approach using only Flutter provided APIs to
update state and notify the UI of changes.


- [State Management using ValueNotifier and InheritedNotifier](https://www.hungrimind.com/articles/flutter-state-management), by Tadas Petra


### `InheritedWidget` and `InheritedModel`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#inheritedwidget-and-inheritedmodel)

The low-level approach used to
communicate between ancestors and children in the widget tree.
This is what `package:provider` and many other approaches use under the hood.


The following instructor-led video workshop covers how to
use `InheritedWidget`:


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "How to manage application state using inherited widgets"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/LFcGPS6cGrY)

Other useful docs include:

- [InheritedWidget docs](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html)
- [Managing Flutter Application State With InheritedWidgets](https://blog.flutter.dev/managing-flutter-application-state-with-inheritedwidgets-1140452befe1),

- [Widget - State - Context - InheritedWidget](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/06/widget---state---context---inheritedwidget/), by Didier Bolelens


## Community-provided packages

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#community-provided-packages)

Depending on the complexity of your app and preferences of your team,
you might find adopting a state management package useful.
State management packages often help reduce boilerplate code,
provide specialized debugging tools, and can help
enable a clearer and consistent application architecture.


The Flutter community offers a wide variety of state management packages.
The best choice for your app often depends on the app's complexity,
your team's preferences, and the specific problems you need to solve.


To begin exploring the available options,
check out the [`#state-management`](https://pub.dev/packages?q=topic%3Astate-management)
topic on the pub.dev site and
refine the search to find packages that match your needs.

[vertical\_align\_topUI design & styling](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/ui-design-and-styling#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

To create an accessible app, design your UI with accessibility in mind.
This page covers key aspects of accessible UI design and styling.


## Large fonts

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/ui-design-and-styling#large-fonts)

Both Android and iOS contain system settings to configure the desired font
sizes used by apps. Flutter text widgets respect this OS setting when
determining font sizes.


Font sizes are calculated automatically by Flutter based on the OS setting.
However, as a developer you should make sure your layout has enough room to
render all its contents when the font sizes are increased.
For example, you can test all parts of your app on a small-screen
device configured to use the largest font setting.


To adjust font sizes: on iOS, go to
Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size;
on Android, go to Settings > Font size.


### Example

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/ui-design-and-styling#example)

The following two screenshots show the standard Flutter app
template rendered with the default iOS font setting,
and with the largest font setting selected in iOS accessibility settings.


![Default font setting](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/a11y/app-regular-fonts.png)

Default font setting

![Largest accessibility font setting](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/a11y/app-large-fonts.png)

Largest accessibility font setting

## Sufficient contrast

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/ui-design-and-styling#sufficient-contrast)

Sufficient color contrast makes text and images easier to read.
Along with benefitting users with various visual impairments,
sufficient color contrast helps all users when viewing an interface
on devices in extreme lighting conditions,
such as when exposed to direct sunlight or on a display with low
brightness.


The [W3C recommends](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html):


- At least 4.5:1 for small text (below 18 point regular or 14 point bold)
- At least 3.0:1 for large text (18 point and above regular or 14 point and
above bold)


You can test contrast using Flutter's [Accessibility Guideline API](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/AccessibilityGuideline-class.html).
For more details on testing, check out the [accessibility testing page](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/accessibility-testing/).


## Tap target size

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/ui-design-and-styling#tap-target-size)

Controls that are too small are hard for many people to interact with and select.
Ensure that interactive elements have a large enough tap target to be easily
pressed by users.


Both [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps#large-controls)
and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility#Mobility)
recommend a minimum tap target size of 48x48 dp and 44x44 pts respectively.


The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/target-size.html) recommends a minimum target size of 44 by 44 CSS pixels.


You can test tap target size using Flutter's [Accessibility Guideline API](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/AccessibilityGuideline-class.html).
For more details on testing, check out the [accessibility testing page](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/accessibility-testing/).


## Other accessibility features

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/ui-design-and-styling#other-accessibility-features)

You can check the [AccessibilityFeatures](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/AccessibilityFeatures-class.html)
class for additional
accessibility features that may be enabled by the platform,
such as bold text, high contrast, and inverted colors.

[Flutter Favorite packages](https://pub.dev/flutter/favorites) on pub.dev.


## Metrics

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/favorites#metrics)

Flutter Favorite packages have passed high quality standards
using the following metrics:


- [Overall package score](https://pub.dev/help)
- **Permissive license**,
including (but not limited to)
Apache, Artistic, BSD, CC BY, MIT, MS-PL and W3C

- GitHub **version tag** matches the current version from
pub.dev, so you can see exactly what source is in the package

- Feature **completeness**—and not marked as incomplete
(for example, with labels like "beta" or "under construction")

- [Verified publisher](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/verified-publishers)
- General **usability** when it comes to the overview,
docs, sample/example code, and API quality

- Good **runtime behavior** in terms of CPU and memory usage
- High quality **dependencies**

## Flutter Ecosystem Committee

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/favorites#flutter-ecosystem-committee)

The Flutter Ecosystem Committee is comprised of Flutter
team members and Flutter community members spread
across its ecosystem.
One of their jobs is to decide when a package
has met the quality bar to become a Flutter Favorite.


The current committee members
(ordered alphabetically by last name)
are as follows:


- Pooja Bhaumik
- Hillel Coren
- Ander Dobo
- Majid Hajian
- Simon Lightfoot
- John Ryan
- Diego Velasquez

If you'd like to nominate a package or plugin as a
potential future Flutter Favorite, or would like
to bring any other issues to the attention of the committee,
[send the committee](mailto:flutter-committee@googlegroups.com) an email.


## Flutter Favorite usage guidelines

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/favorites#flutter-favorite-usage-guidelines)

Flutter Favorite packages are labeled as such on pub.dev
by the Flutter team.
If you own a package that has been designated as a Flutter Favorite,
you must adhere to the following guidelines:


- Flutter Favorite package authors can place the Flutter Favorite
logo in the package's GitHub README, on the package's
pub.dev **Overview** tab,
and on social media as related to posts about that package.

- We encourage you to use the **#FlutterFavorite**
hashtag in social media.

- When using the Flutter Favorite logo,
the author must link to (this) Flutter Favorite landing page,
to provide context for the designation.

- If a Flutter Favorite package loses its Flutter Favorite status,
the author will be notified,
at which point the author must immediately remove all uses
of "Flutter Favorite" and the Flutter Favorite logo from
the affected package.

- Don't alter, distort,
or modify the Flutter Favorite logo in any way,
including displaying the logo with color variations
or unapproved visual elements.

- Don't display the Flutter Favorite logo in a manner that
is misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous,
disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable to Google.


## What's next

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/favorites#whats-next)

You should expect the list of Flutter Favorite packages
to grow and change as the ecosystem continues to thrive.
The committee will continue working with package authors
to increase quality, as well as consider other areas of the
ecosystem that could benefit from the Flutter Favorite program,
such as tools, consulting firms, and prolific Flutter contributors.


As the Flutter ecosystem grows,
we'll be looking at expanding the set of metrics,
which might include the following:


- Use of the [pubspec.yaml format](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin-platforms)
that clearly
indicates which platforms a plugin supports.

- Support for the latest stable version of Flutter.
- Support for AndroidX.
- Support for multiple platforms, such as web, macOS,
Windows, Linux, etc.

- Integration as well as unit test coverage.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This page provides guidance on optimizing your
app to improve its behavior on large screens.


Flutter, like Android, defines [large screens](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/get-started-with-large-screens)
as tablets,
foldables, and ChromeOS devices running Android. Flutter
_also_ defines large screen devices as web, desktop,
and iPads.


## Layout with GridView

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens#layout-with-gridview)

Consider the following screenshots of an app.
The app displays its UI in a `ListView`.
The image on the left shows the app running
on a mobile device. The image on the right shows the
app running on a large screen device
_before the advice on this page was applied_.


![Sample of large screen](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screen.png)

This is not optimal.

The [Android Large Screen App Quality Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality)

and the [iOS equivalent](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ipados)

say that neither text nor boxes should take up the
full screen width. How to solve this in an adaptive way?


A common solution uses `GridView`, as shown in the next section.

### GridView

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens#gridview)

You can use the `GridView` widget to transform
your existing `ListView` into more reasonably-sized items.


`GridView` is similar to the [`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
widget,
but instead of handling only a list of widgets arranged linearly,
`GridView` can arrange widgets in a two-dimensional array.


`GridView` also has constructors that are similar to `ListView`.
The `ListView` default constructor maps to `GridView.count`,
and `ListView.builder` is similar to `GridView.builder`.


`GridView` has some additional constructors for more custom layouts.
To learn more, visit the [`GridView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html)
API page.


For example, if your original app used a `ListView.builder`,
swap that out for a `GridView.builder`.
If your app has a large number of items,
it's recommended to use this builder constructor to only
build the item widgets that are actually visible.


Most of the parameters in the constructor are the same between
the two widgets, so it's a straightforward swap.
However, you need to figure out what to set for the `gridDelegate`.


Flutter provides powerful premade `gridDelegates`
that you can use, namely:


[`SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount-class.html)

Lets you assign a specific number of columns to your grid.

[`SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent-class.html)

Lets you define a max item width.

### Other solutions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens#other-solutions)

Another way to approach these situations is to
use the `maxWidth` property of `BoxConstraints`.
This involves the following:


- Wrap the `GridView`in a `ConstrainedBox` and give
it a `BoxConstraints` with a maximum width set.

- Use a `Container` instead of a `ConstrainedBox`
if you want other functionality like setting the
background color.


For choosing the maximum width value,
consider using the values recommended
by Material 3 in the [Applying layout](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/applying-layout/window-size-classes)
guide.


## Foldables

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens#foldables)

As mentioned previously, Android and Flutter both
recommend in their design guidance **not**
to lock screen orientation,
but some apps lock screen orientation anyway.
Be aware that this can cause problems when running your
app on a foldable device.


When running on a foldable, the app might look ok
when the device is folded. But when unfolding,
you might find the app letterboxed.


As described in the [SafeArea & MediaQuery](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery)
page,
letterboxing means that the app's window is locked to
the center of the screen while the window is
surrounded with black.


Why can this happen?

This can happen when using `MediaQuery` to figure out
the window size for your app. When the device is folded,
orientation is restricted to portrait mode.
Under the hood, `setPreferredOrientations` causes
Android to use a portrait compatibility mode and the app
is displayed in a letterboxed state.
In the letterboxed state, `MediaQuery` never receives
the larger window size that allows the UI to expand.


You can solve this in one of two ways:

- Support all orientations.
- Use the dimensions of the _physical display_.
In fact, this is one of the _few_ situations where
you would use the physical display dimensions and
_not_ the window dimensions.


How to obtain the physical screen dimensions?

You can use the [`Display`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Display-class.html)
API, introduced in
Flutter 3.13, which contains the size,
pixel ratio, and the refresh rate of the physical device.


The following sample code retrieves a `Display` object:

dart

```
/// AppState object.
ui.FlutterView? _view;
​
@override
void didChangeDependencies() {
  super.didChangeDependencies();
  _view = View.maybeOf(context);
}
​
void didChangeMetrics() {
  final ui.Display? display = _view?.display;
}
```

content\_copy

The important thing is to find the display of the
view that you care about. This creates a forward-looking
API that should handle current _and_ future multi-display
and multi-view devices.


## Adaptive input

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens#adaptive-input)

Adding support for more screens, also means
expanding input controls.


Android guidelines describe three tiers of large format device support.

![3 tiers of large format device support](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screen-guidelines.png)

Tier 3, the lowest level of support,
includes support for mouse and stylus input
( [Material 3 guidelines](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality),
[Apple guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ipados#Best-practices)).


If your app uses Material 3 and its buttons and selectors,
then your app already has built-in support for
various additional input states.


But what if you have a custom widget?
Check out the [User input](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input) page for
guidance on adding
[input support for widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#custom-widgets).


### Navigation

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens#navigation)

Navigation can create unique challenges when working with a variety of
differently-sized devices. Generally, you want to switch between
a [`BottomNavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html)
and a [`NavigationRail`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationRail-class.html)
depending on
available screen space.


For more information (and corresponding example code),
check out [Problem: Navigation rail](https://blog.flutter.dev/developing-flutter-apps-for-large-screens-53b7b0e17f10#:~:text=Problem%3A%20Navigation%20rail1), a section in the
[Developing Flutter apps for Large screens](https://blog.flutter.dev/developing-flutter-apps-for-large-screens-53b7b0e17f10)
article.

## Summary

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/assistive-technologies#summary)

Assistive technologies are essential for making digital content accessible to
individuals with disabilities. This document provides an overview of two key
categories of assistive technologies relevant to Flutter development: screen
readers for users with visual impairments and mobility support tools for
those with motor limitations. By understanding and testing with these
technologies, you can ensure your Flutter application provides a more inclusive
and user-friendly experience for everyone.


## Screen readers

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/assistive-technologies#screen-readers)

For mobile, screen readers ( [TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en),
[VoiceOver](https://www.apple.com/lae/accessibility/iphone/vision/))
enable visually impaired users to get spoken feedback about
the contents of the screen and interact with the UI by using
gestures on mobile and keyboard shortcuts on desktop.
Turn on VoiceOver or TalkBack on your mobile device and
navigate around your app.


**To turn on the screen reader on your device, complete the following steps:**

- [Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/assistive-technologies#6-tab-panel)
- [iOS or iPadOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/assistive-technologies#7-tab-panel)
- [Browsers](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/assistive-technologies#8-tab-panel)
- [Desktop](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/assistive-technologies#9-tab-panel)

1. On your device, open **Settings**.
2. Select **Accessibility** and then **TalkBack**.
3. Turn 'Use TalkBack' on or off.
4. Select Ok.

To learn how to find and customize Android's
accessibility features, view the following video.


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Customize Pixel and Android accessibility features"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/FQyj_XTl01w)

1. On your device, open **Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver**
2. Turn the VoiceOver setting on or off

To learn how to find and customize iOS
accessibility features, view the following video.


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "How to navigate your iPhone or iPad with VoiceOver"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/ROIe49kXOc8)

For web, the following screen readers are currently supported:

Mobile browsers:

- iOS - VoiceOver
- Android - TalkBack

Desktop browsers:

- macOS - VoiceOver
- Windows - JAWs & NVDA

Screen readers users on web must toggle the
"Enable accessibility" button to build the semantics tree.
Users can skip this step if you programmatically auto-enable
accessibility for your app using this API:


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/semantics.dart';
​
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
  SemanticsBinding.instance.ensureSemantics();
}
```

content\_copy

Windows comes with a screen reader called Narrator
but some developers recommend using the more popular
NVDA screen reader. To learn about using NVDA to test
Windows apps, check out
[Screen Readers 101 For Front-End Developers (Windows)](https://get-evinced.com/blog/screen-readers-101-for-front-end-developers-windows).


On a Mac, you can use the desktop version of VoiceOver,
which is included in macOS.


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Screen reader basics: VoiceOver"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/5R-6WvAihms)

On Linux, a popular screen reader is called Orca.
It comes pre-installed with some distributions
and is available on package repositories such as `apt`.
To learn about using Orca, check out
[Getting started with Orca screen reader on Gnome desktop](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/getting-started-with-orca).


Check out the following [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6Sx0lBP8PI) to see how to
use VoiceOver with the now-archived [Flutter Gallery](https://flutter-gallery-archive.web.app/)
web app.


Flutter's standard widgets generate an accessibility tree automatically.
However, if your app needs something different,
it can be customized using the [`Semantics` widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html).


When there is text in your app that should be voiced
with a specific voice, inform the screen reader
which voice to use by calling [`TextSpan.locale`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextSpan/locale.html).
`MaterialApp.locale` and `Localizations.override`
will affect screen reader voices starting from flutter 3.38 release.
Usually, the screen reader uses the system voice
except where you explicitly set it with `TextSpan.locale`.


## Mobility support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/assistive-technologies#mobility-support)

For users with limited dexterity or hand strength, mobility support features
can be helpful. Both Android and iOS offer a range of tools designed to make
navigation and control easier.
These features allow users to operate their devices through external switches,
voice commands, or simplified on-screen menus.


Android provides Switch Access, Voice Access and Accessibility Menu,
while iOS offers Switch Control, Voice Control, and AssistiveTouch.
Understanding these tools helps in creating
apps that are usable by people with diverse physical abilities.


| OS | Features | Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | **Switch Access** | As an alternate input method, you can use Switch Access and Camera Switches |
| Android | **Voice Access** | Control your device with your voice |
| Android | **Accessibility Menu** | A floating, on-screen menu that provides simplified buttons to control essential phone functions. |
| iOS | **Switch Control** | Use switches as an alternate input methods |
| iOS | **Voice Control** | Control your device with your voice |
| iOS | **AssistiveTouch** | Use AssistiveTouch to replace multi-finger gestures or hardware button actions |

[vertical\_align\_topLeveraging Apple's system APIs and frameworks](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/apple-frameworks#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

When you come from iOS development, you might need to find
Flutter plugins that offer the same abilities as Apple's system
libraries. This might include accessing device hardware or interacting
with specific frameworks like `HealthKit`.


For an overview of how the SwiftUI framework compares to Flutter,
see [Flutter for SwiftUI developers](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/swiftui-devs).


## Introducing Flutter plugins

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/apple-frameworks#introducing-flutter-plugins)

Dart calls libraries that contain platform-specific code _plugins_,
short for "plugin package".
When developing an app with Flutter, you use _plugins_ to interact
with system libraries.


In your Dart code, you use the plugin's Dart API to call the native
code from the system library being used. This means that you can write
the code to call the Dart API. The API then makes it work for all
platforms that the plugin supports.


To learn more about plugins, see [Using packages](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages).
Though this page links to some popular plugins,
you can find thousands more, along with examples,
on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages).
The following table does not endorse any particular plugin.
If you can't find a package that meets your needs,
you can create your own or
use platform channels directly in your project.
To learn more, check out [Writing platform-specific code](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels).


## Adding a plugin to your project

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/apple-frameworks#adding-a-plugin-to-your-project)

To use an Apple framework within your native project,
import it into your Swift or Objective-C file.


To add a Flutter plugin, run `flutter pub add package_name`
from the root of your project.
This adds the dependency to your [`pubspec.yaml`](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/pubspec)
file.
After you add the dependency, add an `import` statement for the package
in your Dart file.


You might need to change app settings or initialization logic.
If that's needed, the package's "Readme" page on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages)

should provide details.

This guide discusses the Dart and Flutter MCP server.

## Overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#overview)

The [Dart and Flutter MCP server](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/tree/main/pkgs/dart_mcp_server)

exposes Dart and Flutter development tool actions to
compatible AI-assistant clients. MCP (model context protocol)
is a protocol that enables communication between development tools
and AI assistants, allowing the assistants to understand the
context of the code and perform actions on behalf of the developer.


The Dart and Flutter MCP server can work with any MCP client that
supports standard I/O (stdio) as the transport medium.
To access all the features of the Dart and Flutter MCP server,
an MCP client must support [Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools)
and [Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources).
For the best development experience with the Dart and Flutter MCP server,
an MCP client should also support [Roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/roots).


If you are using a client that claims it
supports roots but doesn't actually set them,
pass `--force-roots-fallback` to enable tools for managing the roots.


The Dart and Flutter MCP server provides a growing list of tools that
grant AI assistants deep insights into your project.
Here is an overview of a few things it can do:


- Analyze and fix errors in your project's code.
- Resolve symbols to elements to ensure their existence and
fetch documentation and signature information for them.

- Introspect and interact with your running application.
- Search the [pub.dev site](https://pub.dev/) for the best package for a use case.
- Manage package dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
- Run tests and analyze the results.
- Format code with the same formatter and config as
[`dart format`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format) and the Dart analysis server.


## Set up your MCP client

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#set-up-your-mcp-client)

Run the server with the `dart mcp-server` command,
which must be configured in your preferred client.


This section provides instructions for setting up the
Dart and Flutter MCP server with popular tools such as
Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.


### Antigravity

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#antigravity)

To configure Google [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server,
you can either install it from the list of available servers or
[connect it as a custom MCP server](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp#connecting-custom-mcp-servers).


1. Navigate to or open the **Agent** side panel.

If it's closed, open it by either:
   - Pressing `Control` \+ `L`.
   - Going to **View** > **Open View...** > **Agent**.
2. In the upper right of the **Agent** panel,
    click the **Additional options** (`...`) menu button.

3. Select **MCP Servers**.

4. In the upper right of the **Agent** panel,
    click **Manage MCP Servers**.


From here, you can choose to install the MCP server from
[the built-in MCP store](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#antigravity-mcp-store-install) or by
[configuring it manually](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#antigravity-mcp-manual-install).


#### Install from the MCP store

check out [Develop Flutter apps in VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code).


### Gemini CLI

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#gemini-cli)

To configure the [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/) to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server,
add a Dart entry to the `mcpServers` section of the Gemini config.


- To enable the server for all projects on your device,
edit the `~/.gemini/settings.json` file in your home directory.

- To enable the server for a specific project,
edit the `.gemini/settings.json` file in the project's root directory.


.gemini/settings.json

json

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dart": {
      "command": "dart",
      "args": [\
        "mcp-server"\
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

For more information, check out the official Gemini CLI
documentation for [setting up MCP servers](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/#how-to-set-up-your-mcp-server).


### Firebase Studio

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#firebase-studio)

If you wish to use the Dart and Flutter MCP Server in [Firebase Studio](https://firebase.studio/),
an agentic cloud-based development environment that helps
you build and ship production-quality full-stack AI apps,
follow these steps:


1. In your Firebase Studio app project, create a
    `.idx/mcp.json` file in your project if it
    doesn't exist already and add the following
    Dart and Flutter MCP Server configuration to the file:



.idx/mcp.json



json

```
{
     "mcpServers": {
       "dart": {
         "command": "dart",
         "args": [\
           "mcp-server"\
         ]
       }
     }
}
```

content\_copy

2. Ensure your environment is running Dart SDK 3.9/Flutter 3.35 or later.

3. Rebuild your workspace to complete the setup.
   - Open the Command Palette ( **Shift+Ctrl+P**).
   - Enter **Firebase Studio: Rebuild Environment**.

For more information about MCP server configuration in Firebase Studio,
check out [Connect to MCP servers](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/mcp-servers)
and
[Customize your Firebase Studio workspace](https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/customize-workspace).


### Gemini Code Assist in VS Code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#gemini-code-assist-in-vs-code)

[Gemini Code Assist](https://codeassist.google/)'s [Agent mode](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer)
integrates the
Gemini CLI to provide a powerful AI agent directly in your IDE.
If you haven't set up Gemini Code Assist or its agent mode yet,
follow its [Before you begin instructions](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin)
to get started.


To configure Gemini Code Assist to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server,
follow the instructions to [configure the Gemini CLI](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#gemini-cli).


You can verify the MCP server has been configured
properly by typing `/mcp` in the chat window in Agent mode.


For more information see the official Gemini Code Assist
documentation for [using agent mode](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/use-agentic-chat-pair-programmer#before-you-begin).


### GitHub Copilot in VS Code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#github-copilot-in-vs-code)

By default, the Dart extension uses the
[VS Code MCP API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/mcp)
to register the Dart and Flutter MCP server, as well
as a tool to provide the URI for the active Dart Tooling Daemon.


Explicitly enable or disable the Dart and Flutter MCP server by
configuring the `dart.mcpServer` setting in your VS Code settings.


To change this globally, update your user settings:

1. In VS Code, click **View > Command Palette** and then
    search for **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.

2. Add the following setting:



json

```
"dart.mcpServer": true
```

content\_copy


If you'd like this setting to apply only to a specific workspace,
add the entry to your workspace settings:


1. In VS Code, click **View > Command Palette** and then
    search for **Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)**.

2. Add the following setting:



json

```
"dart.mcpServer": true
```

content\_copy


For more information, see the official VS Code
documentation for [enabling MCP support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_enable-mcp-support-in-vs-code).


### Cursor

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#cursor)

The easiest way to configure the Dart and Flutter MCP server with
Cursor is by clicking the **Add to Cursor** button:


[![Add to Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=dart&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiZGFydCBtY3Atc2VydmVyIn0%3D)[![Add to Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=dart&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiZGFydCBtY3Atc2VydmVyIn0%3D)

Alternatively, you can configure the server manually:

1. Go to **Cursor > Settings > Cursor Settings > Tools & Integrations**.

2. Click **Add Custom MCP** or **New MCP Server**
    depending on whether you already have other MCP servers configured.

3. Edit the `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your local project
    (configuration will only apply to this project) or
    edit the global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory
    (configuration will apply for all projects) to
    configure the Dart and Flutter MCP server:



.cursor/mcp.json



json

```
{
     "mcpServers": {
       "dart": {
         "command": "dart",
         "args": [\
           "mcp-server"\
         ]
       }
     }
}
```

content\_copy


For more information, see the official Cursor
documentation for [installing MCP servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#installing-mcp-servers).


### OpenCode

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#opencode)

To configure [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server,
add the `dart-mcp-server` entry to your OpenCode configuration.


OpenCode configuration is typically found in `~/.opencode/config.json`
or in your project's `opencode key` configuration.


~/.opencode/config.json

json

```
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "dart-mcp-server": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [\
        "dart",\
        "mcp-server"\
      ],
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": {}
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

### Claude Code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#claude-code)

To configure Claude Code to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server
for the current project, use the `claude mcp add` CLI command:


```
$ claude mcp add --transport stdio dart -- dart mcp-server
```

content\_copy

check out their documentation on [Installing MCP servers](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#installing-mcp-servers).


### Codex CLI

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#codex-cli)

To configure the Codex CLI to use the Dart and Flutter MCP server
for the current project, use the `codex mcp add` CLI command:


```
$ codex mcp add dart -- dart mcp-server --force-roots-fallback
```

content\_copy

To learn more about configuring MCP servers in the Codex CLI,
check out their documentation on [Connecting to MCP servers](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp).


## Use your MCP client

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#use-your-mcp-client)

Once you've set up the Dart and Flutter MCP server with a client,
the Dart and Flutter MCP server enables the client to not only reason
about your project's context but also to take action with tools.


The [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/resources/intro-llms)
decides which tools to use and when,
so you can focus on describing your goal in natural language.
Let's see this in action with a couple of examples using
GitHub Copilot's Agent mode in VS Code.


### Fix a runtime layout error in a Flutter app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#fix-a-runtime-layout-error-in-a-flutter-app)

We've all been there: you build a beautiful UI, run the app,
and are greeted by the infamous yellow-and-black stripes of
a RenderFlex overflow error.
Instead of manually debugging the widget tree, you can now
ask your AI assistant for help with a prompt similar to the following:


> Check for and fix static and runtime analysis issues.
> Check for and fix any layout issues.

Behind the scenes, the AI agent uses the Dart and Flutter MCP server's tools to:

- See the error: It uses a tool to get the current runtime errors
from the running application.

- Inspect the UI: It accesses the Flutter widget tree to understand
the layout that is causing the overflow.

- Apply a fix: Armed with this context, it applies a fix and
checks once more for any remaining errors.


You can then keep or undo the code changes.

### Add new functionality with package search

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/mcp-server#add-new-functionality-with-package-search)

Imagine you need to add a chart to your app.
Which package should you use? How do you add it and write the boilerplate?
The Dart and Flutter MCP server can streamline this entire process with
a prompt similar to the following:


> Find a suitable package to add a line chart that
> maps the number of button presses over time.

The AI agent now acts as a true assistant:

- Find the right tool: It uses the `pub_dev_search` tool to
find popular and highly-rated charting libraries.

- Manage dependencies: After you confirm its choice,
such as [`package:fl_chart`](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart),
it uses a tool to add the package as a dependency.

- Generate the code: It generates the new widget code,
complete with boilerplate for a line chart that it places in the UI.
It even self-corrects syntax errors introduced during the process.
You can customize further from there.


What used to be a multi-step process of research,
reading documentation, editing `pubspec.yaml`, and
writing the appropriate code in your app,
is now a single request.

[vertical\_align\_topBuild Linux apps with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/building#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This page discusses considerations unique to building
Linux apps with Flutter, including shell integration
and preparation of apps for distribution.


## Integrate with Linux

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/building#integrate-with-linux)

The Linux programming interface,
comprising library functions and system calls,
is designed around the C language and ABI.
Fortunately, Dart provides the `dart:ffi` package,
which enables Dart programs to call into C libraries.


Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI) allow Flutter apps to perform the
following with native libraries:


- allocate native memory with `malloc` or `calloc`
- support pointers, structs, and callbacks
- support Application Binary Interface (ABI) types like `long` and `size_t`

To learn more about calling C libraries from Flutter,
consult [C interop using `dart:ffi`](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop).


Many apps benefit from using a package that wraps the underlying library
calls in a more convenient, idiomatic Dart API.
[Canonical has built a series of packages](https://pub.dev/publishers/canonical.com/packages)

with a focus on enabling Dart and Flutter on Linux,
including support for desktop notifications,
dbus, network management, and Bluetooth.


In general, many other [packages support creating Linux apps](https://pub.dev/packages?q=platform%3Alinux),
including common packages such as [`url_launcher`](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher),
[`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences),
[`file_selector`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_selector), and [`path_provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider).


## Prepare Linux apps for distribution

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/building#prepare-linux-apps-for-distribution)

The executable binary can be found in your project under
`build/linux/x64/<build mode>/bundle/`.
Alongside your executable binary in the `bundle` directory,
you can find two directories:


- `lib` contains the required `.so` library files
- `data` contains the application's data assets, such as fonts or images

In addition to these files, your application also relies on various
operating system libraries against which it's been compiled.
To see the full list of libraries,
use the `ldd` command on your application's directory.


For example, assume you have a Flutter desktop application
called `linux_desktop_test`.
To inspect the its system library dependencies, use the following commands:


```
$ flutter build linux --release
$ ldd build/linux/x64/release/bundle/linux_desktop_test
```

content\_copy

To wrap up this application for distribution,
include everything in the `bundle` directory
and verify the target Linux system has all required system libraries.


This might only require using the following command.

```
$ sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 libblkid1 liblzma5
```

content\_copy

To learn how to publish a Linux application to the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store),
consult [Build and release a Linux application to the Snap Store](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux).


## Additional resources

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/building#additional-resources)

To learn how to create Linux Debian (`.deb`) and RPM (`.rpm`)
builds of your Flutter desktop app,
consult the step-by-step [Linux packaging guide](https://medium.com/@fluttergems/packaging-and-distributing-flutter-desktop-apps-the-missing-guide-part-3-linux-24ef8d30a5b4).

## Key-Value Storage
[Skip to main content](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#site-content-title)

docs.flutter.dev uses cookies from Google to deliver and enhance the quality of its services and to analyze traffic.

listOn this pagechevron\_rightStore key-value data on disk

[vertical\_align\_topStore key-value data on disk](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

If you have a relatively small collection of key-values
to save, you can use the [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
plugin.


Normally, you would have to
write native platform integrations for storing data on each platform.
Fortunately, the [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
plugin can be used to
persist key-value data to disk on each platform Flutter supports.


This recipe uses the following steps:

1. Add the dependency.
2. Save data.
3. Read data.
4. Remove data.

## 1\. Add the dependency

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#1-add-the-dependency)

Before starting, add the [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences)
package as a dependency.


To add the `shared_preferences` package as a dependency,
run `flutter pub add`:


```
flutter pub add shared_preferences
```

content\_copy

## 2\. Save data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#2-save-data)

To persist data, use the setter methods provided by the
`SharedPreferences` class. Setter methods are available for
various primitive types, such as `setInt`, `setBool`, and `setString`.


Setter methods do two things: First, synchronously update the
key-value pair in memory. Then, persist the data to disk.


dart

```
// Load and obtain the shared preferences for this app.
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
​
// Save the counter value to persistent storage under the 'counter' key.
await prefs.setInt('counter', counter);
```

content\_copy

## 3\. Read data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#3-read-data)

To read data, use the appropriate getter method provided by the
`SharedPreferences` class. For each setter there is a corresponding getter.
For example, you can use the `getInt`, `getBool`, and `getString`
methods.


dart

```
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
​
// Try reading the counter value from persistent storage.
// If not present, null is returned, so default to 0.
final counter = prefs.getInt('counter') ?? 0;
```

content\_copy

Note that the getter methods throw an exception if the persisted value
has a different type than the getter method expects.


## 4\. Remove data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#4-remove-data)

To delete data, use the `remove()` method.

dart

```
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
​
// Remove the counter key-value pair from persistent storage.
await prefs.remove('counter');
```

content\_copy

## Supported types

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#supported-types)

Although the key-value storage provided by `shared_preferences` is
easy and convenient to use, it has limitations:


- Only primitive types can be used: `int`, `double`, `bool`, `String`,
and `List<String>`.

- It's not designed to store large amounts of data.
- There is no guarantee that data will be persisted across app restarts.

## Testing support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#testing-support)

It's a good idea to test code that persists data using `shared_preferences`.
To enable this, the package provides an
in-memory mock implementation of the preference store.


To set up your tests to use the mock implementation,
call the `setMockInitialValues` static method in
a `setUpAll()` method in your test files.
Pass in a map of key-value pairs to use as the initial values.


dart

```
SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues(<String, Object>{'counter': 2});
```

content\_copy

## Complete example

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/persistence/key-value#complete-example)

dart

      prefs.setInt('counter', _counter);
    });
  }

        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

[vertical\_align\_topAccessibility testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/accessibility-testing#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

## Accessibility regulations

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/accessibility-testing#accessibility-regulations)

To ensure your app is accessible, check it against public standards like the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), the
[EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf),
and use resources like the [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)](https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat)

to self-assess your product. For more details on these
regulations, check out the main [accessibility page](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility).


## Inspecting accessibility support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/accessibility-testing#inspecting-accessibility-support)

We recommend using automated accessibility scanners to test the following:

- For Android:
1. Install the [Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor&hl=en)
      for Android
2. Enable the Accessibility Scanner from
      **Android Settings > Accessibility >**
     **Accessibility Scanner > On**.
3. Navigate to the Accessibility Scanner 'checkbox'
      icon button to initiate a scan.
- For iOS:
1. Open the `iOS` folder of your Flutter app in Xcode.
2. Select a Simulator as the target, and click the **Run** button.
3. In Xcode, select
      **Xcode > Open Developer Tools > Accessibility Inspector**.
4. In the Accessibility Inspector,
      select **Inspection > Enable Point to Inspect**,
      and then select the various user interface elements in your running
      Flutter app to inspect their accessibility attributes.
5. In the Accessibility Inspector,
      select **Audit** in the toolbar, and then
      select **Run Audit** to get a report of potential issues.
- For web:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (or similar tools in other browsers).
2. Inspect the HTML tree under semantics host, containing the ARIA
      attributes generated by Flutter.
3. In Chrome, the "Elements" tab has an "Accessibility" sub-tab
      that can be used to inspect the data exported to semantics tree.

## Testing accessibility on mobile

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/accessibility-testing#testing-accessibility-on-mobile)

Test your app using Flutter's [Accessibility Guideline API](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/AccessibilityGuideline-class.html).
This API checks if your app's UI meets Flutter's accessibility recommendations.
These cover recommendations for text contrast, target size, and target labels.


The following snippet shows how to use the Guideline API on
a sample widget named `AccessibleApp`:


test/a11y\_test.dart

dart

```
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:your_accessible_app/main.dart';
​
void main() {
  testWidgets('Follows a11y guidelines', (tester) async {
    final SemanticsHandle handle = tester.ensureSemantics();
    await tester.pumpWidget(const AccessibleApp());
​
    // Checks that tappable nodes have a minimum size of 48 by 48 pixels
    // for Android.
    await expectLater(tester, meetsGuideline(androidTapTargetGuideline));
​
    // Checks that tappable nodes have a minimum size of 44 by 44 pixels
    // for iOS.
    await expectLater(tester, meetsGuideline(iOSTapTargetGuideline));
​
    // Checks that touch targets with a tap or long press action are labeled.
    await expectLater(tester, meetsGuideline(labeledTapTargetGuideline));
​
    // Checks whether semantic nodes meet the minimum text contrast levels.
    // The recommended text contrast is 3:1 for larger text
    // (18 point and above regular).
    await expectLater(tester, meetsGuideline(textContrastGuideline));
    handle.dispose();
  });
}
```

content\_copy

To try these tests out, run them on the app you create in the
[Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) codelab.
Each button on that app's main screen serves as a tappable target
with text rendered in an 18-point font.


You can add Guideline API tests alongside other [widget tests](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/overview#widget-tests),
or in a separate file, such as `test/a11y_test.dart` in this example.


## Testing accessibility on the web

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/accessibility-testing#testing-accessibility-on-the-web)

You can debug accessibility by visualizing the semantic nodes created for your web app
using the following command line flag in profile and release modes:


```
flutter run -d chrome --profile --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_DEBUG_SHOW_SEMANTICS=true
```

content\_copy

With the flag activated, the semantic nodes appear on top of the widgets;
you can verify that the semantic elements are placed where they should be.
If the semantic nodes are incorrectly placed, please [file a bug report](https://goo.gle/flutter_web_issue).

### Updating the plugins

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#updating)

Updates to the plugins are shipped on a regular basis.
You should be prompted in the IDE when an update is available.


To check for updates manually:

1. Open preferences ( **Android Studio > Check for Updates** on macOS,
    **Help > Check for Updates** on Linux).

2. If `dart` or `flutter` are listed, update them.

## Creating projects

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#creating-projects)

You can create a new project in one of several ways.

### Creating a new project

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#creating-a-new-project)

Creating a new Flutter project from the Flutter starter app template
differs between Android Studio and IntelliJ.


**In Android Studio:**

1. In the IDE, click **New Flutter Project** from the **Welcome** window or
    **File > New > New Flutter Project** from the main IDE window.

2. Specify the **Flutter SDK path** and click **Next**.
3. Enter your desired **Project name**,
    **Description**, and **Project location**.

4. If you might publish this app,
    [set the company domain](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#set-the-company-domain).

5. Click **Finish**.

**In IntelliJ:**

1. In the IDE, click **New Project** from the **Welcome** window or
    **File > New > Project** from the main IDE window.

2. Select **Flutter** from the **Generators** list in the left panel
3. Specify the **Flutter SDK path** and click **Next**.
4. Enter your desired **Project name**,
    **Description**, and **Project location**.

5. If you might publish this app,
    [set the company domain](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#set-the-company-domain).

6. Click **Finish**.

#### Set the company domain

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#set-the-company-domain)

When creating a new app, some Flutter IDE plugins ask for an
organization name in reverse domain order,
something like `com.example`. Along with the name of the app,
this is used as the package name for Android, and the Bundle ID for iOS
when the app is released. If you think you might ever release this app,
it is better to specify these now. They cannot be changed once the app
is released. Your organization name should be unique.


### Opening a project from existing source code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#opening-a-project-from-existing-source-code)

To open an existing Flutter project:

1. In the IDE, click **Open** from the **Welcome** window, or
    **File > Open** from the main IDE window.

2. Browse to the directory holding your existing
    Flutter source code files.

3. Click **Open**.


## Editing code and viewing issues

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#editing-code-and-viewing-issues)

The Flutter plugin performs code analysis that enables the following:

- Syntax highlighting.
- Code completions based on rich type analysis.
- Navigating to type declarations ( **Navigate > Declaration**),
and finding type usages ( **Edit > Find > Find Usages**).

- Viewing all current source code problems
( **View > Tool Windows > Dart Analysis**).
Any analysis issues are shown in the Dart Analysis pane:

![Dart Analysis pane](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/dart-analysis.png)

## Running and debugging

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#running-and-debugging)

Running and debugging are controlled from the main toolbar:

![Main IntelliJ toolbar](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/main-toolbar.png)

### Selecting a target

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#selecting-a-target)

When a Flutter project is open in the IDE, you should see a set of
Flutter-specific buttons on the right-hand side of the toolbar.


1. Locate the **Flutter Target Selector** drop-down button.
    This shows a list of available targets.

2. Select the target you want your app to be started on.
    When you connect devices, or start simulators,
    additional entries appear.


### Run app without breakpoints

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#run-app-without-breakpoints)

1. Click the **Play icon** in the toolbar, or invoke **Run > Run**.
    The bottom **Run** pane shows logs output.


### Run app with breakpoints

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#run-app-with-breakpoints)

1. If desired, set breakpoints in your source code.
2. Click the **Debug icon** in the toolbar, or invoke **Run > Debug**.
   - The bottom **Debugger** pane shows Stack Frames and Variables.
   - The bottom **Console** pane shows detailed logs output.
   - Debugging is based on a default launch configuration.
      To customize this, click the drop-down button to the right
      of the device selector, and select **Edit configuration**.

## Fast edit and refresh development cycle

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#fast-edit-and-refresh-development-cycle)

Flutter offers a best-in-class developer cycle enabling you to see the effect
of your changes almost instantly with the _Stateful Hot Reload_ feature.
To learn more, check out [Hot reload](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/hot-reload).


### Show performance data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#show-performance-data)

To view the performance data, including the widget rebuild
information, start the app in **Debug** mode, and then open
the Performance tool window using
**View > Tool Windows > Flutter Performance**.


![Flutter performance window](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/widget-rebuild-info.png)

To see the stats about which widgets are being rebuilt, and how often,
click **Show widget rebuild information** in the **Performance**
pane.
The exact count of the rebuilds for this frame displays in the second
column from the right. For a high number of rebuilds, a yellow spinning
circle displays. The column to the far right shows how many times a
widget was rebuilt since entering the current screen.
For widgets that aren't rebuilt, a solid grey circle displays.
Otherwise, a grey spinning circle displays.


The purpose of this feature is to make you aware when widgets are
rebuilding—you might not realize that this is happening when just
looking at the code. If widgets are rebuilding that you didn't expect,
it's probably a sign that you should refactor your code by splitting
up large build methods into multiple widgets.


This tool can help you debug at least four common performance issues:

1. The whole screen (or large pieces of it) are built by a single
    StatefulWidget, causing unnecessary UI building. Split up the
    UI into smaller widgets with smaller `build()` functions.

2. Offscreen widgets are being rebuilt. This can happen, for example,
    when a ListView is nested in a tall Column that extends offscreen.
    Or when the RepaintBoundary is not set for a list that extends
    offscreen, causing the whole list to be redrawn.

3. The `build()` function for an AnimatedBuilder draws a subtree that
    does not need to be animated, causing unnecessary rebuilds of static
    objects.

4. An Opacity widget is placed unnecessarily high in the widget tree.
    Or, an Opacity animation is created by directly manipulating the
    opacity property of the Opacity widget, causing the widget itself
    and its subtree to rebuild.


You can click on a line in the table to navigate to the line
in the source where the widget is created. As the code runs,
the spinning icons also display in the code pane to help you
visualize which rebuilds are happening.


Note that numerous rebuilds doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.
Typically you should only worry about excessive rebuilds if you have
already run the app in profile mode and verified that the performance
is not what you want.


And remember, _the widget rebuild information is only available in_
_a debug build_. Test the app's performance on a real device in a profile
build, but debug performance issues in a debug build.


## Editing tips for Flutter code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#editing-tips-for-flutter-code)

If you have additional tips we should share, [let us know](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new)!


### Assists & quick fixes

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#assists-quick-fixes)

Assists are code changes related to a certain code identifier.
A number of these are available when the cursor is placed on a
Flutter widget identifier, as indicated by the yellow lightbulb icon.
The assist can be invoked by clicking the lightbulb, or by using the
keyboard shortcut (`Alt`+`Enter` on Linux and Windows,
`Option`+`Return` on macOS), as illustrated here:


![IntelliJ editing assists](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/assists.webp)

Quick Fixes are similar, only they are shown with a piece of code has an error
and they can assist in correcting it. They are indicated with a red lightbulb.


#### Wrap with new widget assist

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#wrap-with-new-widget-assist)

This can be used when you have a widget that you want to wrap in a surrounding
widget, for example if you want to wrap a widget in a `Row` or `Column`.


#### Wrap widget list with new widget assist

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#wrap-widget-list-with-new-widget-assist)

Similar to the assist above, but for wrapping an existing list of
widgets rather than an individual widget.


#### Convert child to children assist

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#convert-child-to-children-assist)

Changes a child argument to a children argument,
and wraps the argument value in a list.


### Live templates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#live-templates)

Live templates can be used to speed up entering typical code structures.
They are invoked by typing their prefix, and then selecting it in the code
completion window:


![IntelliJ live templates](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/templates.webp)

The Flutter plugin includes the following templates:

- Prefix `stless`: Create a new subclass of `StatelessWidget`.
- Prefix `stful`: Create a new subclass of `StatefulWidget` and
its associated State subclass.

- Prefix `stanim`: Create a new subclass of `StatefulWidget` and its
associated State subclass, including a field initialized with an
`AnimationController`.


You can also define custom templates in **Settings > Editor > Live Templates**.

### Keyboard shortcuts

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#keyboard-shortcuts)

**Hot reload**

On Linux (keymap _Default for XWin_) and Windows the keyboard shortcuts
are `Control`+`Alt`+`;` and `Control`+`Backslash`.


On macOS (keymap _Mac OS X 10.5+ copy_) the keyboard shortcuts are
`Command`+`Option` and `Command`+`Backslash`.


Keyboard mappings can be changed in the IDE Preferences/Settings: Select
_Keymap_, then enter _flutter_ into the search box in the upper right corner.
Right click the binding you want to change and _Add Keyboard Shortcut_.


![IntelliJ settings keymap](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/keymap-settings-flutter-plugin.png)

### Hot reload vs. hot restart

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#hot-reload-vs-hot-restart)

Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running
Dart VM (Virtual Machine). This includes not only adding new classes,
but also adding methods and fields to existing classes,
and changing existing functions.
A few types of code changes cannot be hot reloaded though:


- Global variable initializers
- Static field initializers
- The `main()` method of the app

For these changes you can fully restart your application,
without having to end your debugging session. To perform a hot restart,
don't click the Stop button, simply re-click the Run button (if in a run
session) or Debug button (if in a debug session), or shift-click the 'hot
reload' button.


## Editing Android code in Android Studio with full IDE support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#android-ide)

Opening the root directory of a Flutter project doesn't expose all the Android
files to the IDE. Flutter apps contain a subdirectory named `android`. If you
open this subdirectory as its own separate project in Android Studio, the IDE
will be able to fully support editing and refactoring all Android files (like
Gradle scripts).


If you already have the entire project opened as a Flutter app in Android
Studio, there are two equivalent ways to open the Android files on their own
for editing in the IDE. Before trying this, make sure that you're on the latest
version of Android Studio and the Flutter plugins.


- In the ["project view"](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/#ProjectView), you should see a subdirectory immediately under
the root of your flutter app named `android`. Right click on it,
then select **Flutter > Open Android module in Android Studio**.

- OR, you can open any of the files under the `android` subdirectory for
editing. You should then see a "Flutter commands" banner at the top of the
editor with a link labeled **Open for Editing in Android Studio**.
Click that link.


For both options, Android Studio gives you the option to use separate windows or
to replace the existing window with the new project when opening a second
project. Either option is fine.


If you don't already have the Flutter project opened in Android studio,
you can open the Android files as their own project from the start:


1. Click **Open an existing Android Studio Project** on the Welcome
    splash screen, or **File > Open** if Android Studio is already open.

2. Open the `android` subdirectory immediately under the flutter app root.
    For example if the project is called `flutter_app`,
    open `flutter_app/android`.


If you haven't run your Flutter app yet, you might see Android Studio report a
build error when you open the `android` project. Run `flutter pub get`
in
the app's root directory and rebuild the project by selecting **Build > Make**

to fix it.


## Editing Android code in IntelliJ IDEA

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#edit-android-code)

To enable editing of Android code in IntelliJ IDEA, you need to configure the
location of the Android SDK:


1. In **Preferences > Plugins**, enable **Android Support** if you
    haven't already.

2. Right-click the **android** folder in the Project view, and select **Open**
**Module Settings**.

3. In the **Sources** tab, locate the **Language level** field, and
    select level 8 or later.

4. In the **Dependencies** tab, locate the **Module SDK** field,
    and select an Android SDK. If no SDK is listed, click **New**
    and specify the location of the Android SDK.
    Make sure to select an Android SDK matching the one used by
    Flutter (as reported by `flutter doctor`).

5. Click **OK**.

## Flutter Property Editor

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/android-studio#property-editor)

The Flutter Property Editor is a powerful tool provided by the [Flutter\\
plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter) that lets you view and modify widget properties directly from its
visual interface.


### How to open the Flutter Property Editor in Android Studio and IntelliJ

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Learn how to set up your development environment
to run, build, and deploy Flutter apps for the Linux desktop platform.


## Set up tooling

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/setup#set-up-tooling)

To run and debug desktop Flutter apps on Linux,
download and install the prerequisite packages.


Using your preferred package manager or mechanism,
install the latest versions of the following packages:


- `clang`
- `cmake`
- `ninja-build`
- `pkg-config`
- `libgtk-3-dev`
- `libstdc++-12-dev`

On Debian-based distros with `apt-get`, such as Ubuntu,
install these packages using the following commands:


```
$ sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
$ sudo apt-get install -y clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libstdc++-12-dev
```

content\_copy

## Validate your setup

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/setup#validate-setup)

1. ### Check for toolchain issues


To check for any issues with your Linux development setup,
    run the `flutter doctor` command in your preferred terminal:





```
$ flutter doctor -v
```

content\_copy



If you see any errors or tasks to complete
    under the **Linux toolchain** section,
    complete and resolve them, then
    run `flutter doctor -v` again to verify any changes.

2. ### Check for Linux devices


To ensure Flutter can find and connect to your Linux device correctly,
    run `flutter devices` in your preferred terminal:





```
$ flutter devices
```

content\_copy



If you set everything up correctly,
    there should be at least one entry with the platform marked as **linux**.

3. ### Troubleshoot setup issues


If you need help resolving any setup issues,
    check out [Install and setup troubleshooting](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot).

If you still have issues or questions,
    reach out on one of the Flutter [community](https://flutter.dev/community)
    channels.

## Install and set up Flutter

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/quick#install)

Now that you've installed Git and VS Code,
follow these steps to use VS Code to install and set up Flutter.


1. ### Launch VS Code


If not already open, open VS Code by searching for it with Spotlight
    or opening it manually from the directory where it's installed.

2. ### Add the Flutter extension to VS Code


To add the Dart and Flutter extensions to VS Code,
    visit the [Flutter extension's marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter),
    then click **Install**.
    If prompted by your browser, allow it to open VS Code.

3. ### Install Flutter with VS Code

1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

      Go to **View** > **Command Palette**
       or press `Control` +
       `Shift` \+ `P`.

2. In the command palette, type `flutter`.

3. Select **Flutter: New Project**.

4. VS Code prompts you to locate the Flutter SDK on your computer.
       Select **Download SDK**.

5. When the **Select Folder for Flutter SDK** dialog displays,
       choose where you want to install Flutter.

6. Click **Clone Flutter**.

      While downloading Flutter, VS Code displays this pop-up notification:





      ```
      Downloading the Flutter SDK. This may take a few minutes.
      ```

      content\_copy



      This download takes a few minutes.
       If you suspect that the download has hung, click **Cancel** then
       start the installation again.

7. Click **Add SDK to PATH**.

      When successful, a notification displays:





      ```
      The Flutter SDK was added to your PATH
      ```

      content\_copy

8. VS Code might display a Google Analytics notice.

      If you agree, click **OK**.

9. To ensure that Flutter is available in all terminals:

      1. Close, then reopen all terminal windows.
      2. Restart VS Code.
4. ### Troubleshoot installation issues


If you encounter any issues during installation,
    check out [Flutter installation troubleshooting](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/troubleshoot).


## Test drive Flutter

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/install/quick#test-drive)

Now that you've set up VS Code and Flutter,
it's time to create an app and try out Flutter development!


1. ### Create a new Flutter app

1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

      Go to **View** > **Command Palette**
       or press `Control` +
       `Shift` \+ `P`.

2. In the command palette, start typing `flutter:`.

      VS Code should surface commands from the Flutter plugin.

3. Select the **Flutter: New Project** command.

      Your OS or VS Code might ask for access to your documents,
       agree to continue to the next step.

4. Choose the **Application** template.

      VS Code should prompt you with **Which Flutter template?**.
       Choose **Application** to bootstrap a simple counter app.

5. Create or select the parent directory for your new app's folder.

      A file dialog should appear.

      1. Select or create the parent directory where
          you want the project to be created.
      2. To confirm your selection,
          click **Select a folder to create the project in**.
6. Enter a name for your app.

      VS Code should prompt you to enter a name for your new app.
       Enter `trying_flutter` or a similar `lowercase_with_underscores`
       name.
       To confirm your selection, press `Enter`.

7. Wait for project initialization to complete.

      Task progress is often surfaced as a notification in the bottom right
       and can also be accessed from the **Output** panel.

8. Open the `lib` directory, then the `main.dart` file.

      If you're curious about what each portion of the code does,
       check out the preceding comments throughout the file.
2. ### Run your app on the web


While Flutter apps can run on many platforms,
    try running your new app on the web.
1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

      Go to **View** > **Command Palette**
       or press `Control` +
       `Shift` \+ `P`.

2. In the command palette, start typing `flutter:`.

      VS Code should surface commands from the Flutter plugin.

3. Select the **Flutter: Select Device** command.

4. From the **Select Device** prompt, select **Chrome**.

5. Run or start debugging your app.

      Go to **Run** > **Start Debugging** or press `F5`.

      `flutter run` is used to build and start your app,
       then a new instance of Chrome should open and
       start running your newly created app.
3. ### Try hot reload


Flutter offers a fast development cycle with **stateful hot reload**,
    the ability to reload the code of a live running app without
    restarting or losing app state.

You can change your app's source code,
    run the hot reload command in VS Code,
    then see the change in your running app.
1. In the running app, try adding to the counter a few times by
       clicking the ![increment (+)](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/get-started/increment-button.png)
       button.

2. With your app still running, make a change in the `lib/main.dart` file.

      Change the `_counter++` line in the `_incrementCounter` method
       to instead decrement the `_counter` field.



      dart

      ```
      setState(() {
        // ...
        _counter++;
        _counter--;
      });
      ```

      content\_copy

3. Save your changes
       ( **File** > **Save All**) or
       click the **Hot Reload**![hot reload icon](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/get-started/hot-reload.svg)
       button.

      Flutter updates the running app without losing any existing state.
       Notice the existing value stayed the same.

4. Try clicking the
       ![increment (+)](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/get-started/increment-button.png)
       button again.
       Notice the value decreases instead of increases.
4. ### Explore the Flutter sidebar


The Flutter plugin adds a dedicated sidebar to VS Code
    for managing Flutter debug sessions and devices,
    viewing an outline of your code and widgets,
    as well as accessing the Dart and Flutter DevTools.
1. If your app isn't running, start debugging it again.

      Go to **Run** > **Start Debugging** or press `F5`.

2. Open the Flutter sidebar in VS Code.

      Either open it with the Flutter ![Flutter logo](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/branding/flutter/logo/square.svg)
       button in
       the VS Code sidebar or open it from the command palette by
       running the **Flutter: Focus on Flutter Sidebar View** command.

3. In the Flutter sidebar, under **DevTools**,
       click the **Flutter Inspector** button.

      A separate **Widget Inspector** panel should open in VS Code.

      In the widget inspector, you can view your app's widget tree,
       view the properties and layout of each widget, and more.

4. In the widget inspector, try clicking the top-level `MyHomePage` widget.

      A view of its properties and layout should open, and
       the VS Code editor should navigate to and focus the line where
       the widget was included.

5. Explore and try out other features in
       the widget inspector and Flutter sidebar.

Flutter has many built-in widgets that automatically
scroll and also offers a variety of widgets
that you can customize to create specific scrolling
behavior.


## Basic scrolling

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/scrolling#basic-scrolling)

Many Flutter widgets support scrolling out of the box
and do most of the work for you. For example,
[`SingleChildScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildScrollView-class.html)
automatically scrolls its
child when necessary. Other useful widgets include
[`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
and [`GridView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html).
You can check out more of these widgets on the
[scrolling page](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/scrolling) of the Widget catalog.

[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "ListView \| Flutter widget of the week"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/KJpkjHGiI5A)

### Infinite scrolling

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/scrolling#infinite-scrolling)

When you have a long list of items
in your `ListView` or `GridView` (including an _infinite_
list),
you can build the items on demand
as they scroll into view. This provides a much
more performant scrolling experience.
For more information, check out
[`ListView.builder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView/ListView.builder.html)
or [`GridView.builder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView/GridView.builder.html).


### Specialized scrollable widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/scrolling#specialized-scrollable-widgets)

The following widgets provide more
specific scrolling behavior.


A video on using [`DraggableScrollableSheet`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DraggableScrollableSheet-class.html):


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "DraggableScrollableSheet \| Flutter widget of the week"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/Hgw819mL_78)

Turn the scrollable area into a wheel with [`ListWheelScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListWheelScrollView-class.html)!


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "ListWheelScrollView \| Flutter widget of the week"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/dUhmWAz4C7Y)

## Fancy scrolling

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/scrolling#fancy-scrolling)

Perhaps you want to implement _elastic_ scrolling,
also called _scroll bouncing_. Or maybe you want to
implement other dynamic scrolling effects, like parallax scrolling.
Or perhaps you want a scrolling header with very specific behavior,
such as shrinking or disappearing.


You can achieve all this and more using the
Flutter `Sliver*` classes.
A _sliver_ refers to a piece of the scrollable area.
You can define and insert a sliver into a [`CustomScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomScrollView-class.html)

to have finer-grained control over that area.


For more information, check out
[Using slivers to achieve fancy scrolling](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/scrolling/slivers)

and the [Sliver classes](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/layout#sliver-widgets).


## Nested scrolling widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/scrolling#nested-scrolling-widgets)

How do you nest a scrolling widget
inside another scrolling widget
without hurting scrolling performance?
Do you set the `ShrinkWrap` property to true,
or do you use a sliver?


Check out the "ShrinkWrap vs Slivers" video:

[vertical\_align\_topUse a native language debugger](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

If you write Flutter apps only with Dart code,
you can debug your code using your IDE's debugger.
The Flutter team recommends VS Code.


If you write a platform-specific plugin or
use platform-specific libraries, you can debug
that portion of your code with a native debugger.


- To debug iOS or macOS code written in Swift or Objective-C,
you can use Xcode.

- To debug Android code written in Java or Kotlin,
you can use Android Studio.

- To debug Windows code written in C++, you can use Visual Studio.

This guide shows you how you can connect _two_
debuggers to your Dart app, one for Dart, and one for the native code.


## Debug Dart code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#debug-dart-code)

This guide describes how to use VS Code to debug your Flutter app.
You can also use your preferred IDE with the
Flutter and Dart plugins installed and configured.


## Debug Dart code using VS Code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#debug-dart-code-using-vs-code)

The following procedure explains how to use the Dart debugger
with the default sample Flutter app.
The featured components in VS Code work and appear when
debugging your own Flutter project as well.


1. Create a basic Flutter app.





```
$ flutter create my_app
```

content\_copy







```
Creating project my_app...
Resolving dependencies in my_app...
Got dependencies in my_app.
Wrote 129 files.

All done!
You can find general documentation for Flutter at: https://docs.flutter.dev/
Detailed API documentation is available at: https://api.flutter.dev/
If you prefer video documentation, consider: https://www.youtube.com/c/flutterdev

In order to run your application, type:

     $ cd my_app
     $ flutter run

Your application code is in my_app/lib/main.dart.
```

content\_copy







```
$ cd my_app
```

content\_copy

2. Open the `lib\main.dart` file in the Flutter app using
    VS Code.

3. Click the bug icon
    (![VS Code's bug icon to trigger the debugging mode of a Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/testing/debugging/vscode-ui/icons/debug.png)).
    This opens the following panes in VS Code:


   - **Debug**
   - **Debug Console**
   - **Widget Inspector**

The first time you run the debugger takes the longest.

4. Test the debugger.

a. In `main.dart`, click on this line:



dart

```
_counter++;
```

content\_copy



b. Press `Shift` \+ `F9`.
    This adds a breakpoint where the
    `_counter` variable increments.

c. In the app, click the **+** button
    to increment the counter. The app pauses.

    d. At this point, VS Code displays:
   - In the **Editor Groups**:
     - The highlighted breakpoint in `main.dart`
     - The widget hierarchy for the Flutter app
        in the **Widget Tree** of the **Widget Inspector**
   - In the **side bar**:
     - The state of the app in the **Call Stack** section
     - The value of the `this` local variable in the **Variables** section
   - In the **panel**:
     - The log of the Flutter app in the **Debug console**

### VS Code Flutter debugger

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#vs-code-flutter-debugger)

The Flutter plugin for VS Code adds a number of components
to the VS Code user interface.


#### Changes to VS Code interface

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#changes-to-vs-code-interface)

When launched, the Flutter debugger adds debugging tools to the
VS Code interface.


The following screenshot and table explain the purpose of each tool.

![VS Code with the Flutter plugin UI additions](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/testing/debugging/vscode-ui/screens/debugger-parts.png)

| Highlight Color in Screenshot | Bar, Panel, or Tab | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Yellow** | Variables | List of current values of variables in the Flutter app |
|  | Watch | List of items you chose to track in the Flutter app |
|  | Call Stack | Stack of active subroutines in the Flutter app |
|  | Breakpoints | List of exceptions and set breakpoints that you set |
| **Green** | `<Flutter files>` | Files that you are editing |
| **Pink** | Widget Inspector | Hierarchy of widgets in the running Flutter app |
| **Blue** | Layout Explorer | Visual of how Flutter placed the widget you selected in the Widget Inspector |
|  | Widget Details Tree | List of properties of the widget selected in the Widget Inspector |
| **Orange** | Problems | List of issues the Dart analyzer found in the current Dart file |
|  | Output | Response that the Flutter app returns when building an app |
|  | Debug Console | Logs or error messages that the Flutter app generates while debugging |
|  | Terminal | System shell prompt contained in VS Code |

To change where the panel (in **orange**) appears in VS Code,
go to **View** \> **Appearance** \> **Panel Position**.


#### VS Code Flutter debugging toolbar

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#vs-code-flutter-debugging-toolbar)

The toolbar allows you to debug using any debugger.
You can step in, out, and over Dart statements, hot reload, or resume the app.


![Flutter debugger toolbar in VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/testing/debugging/vscode-ui/screens/debug-toolbar.png)

| Icon | Action | Default keyboard shortcut |

## Update test Flutter app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#update-test-flutter-app)

For the remainder of this guide, you need to update the
test Flutter app. This update adds native code to debug.


1. Open the `lib/main.dart` file using your preferred IDE.

2. Replace the contents of `main.dart` with the following code.

and any native code with its regular debugger.
This capability allows you to leverage Flutter's hot reload
when editing native code.


### Debug Dart and Android code using Android Studio

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#debug-dart-and-android-code-using-android-studio)

To debug native Android code, you need a Flutter app that contains
Android code. In this section, you learn how to connect
the Dart, Java, and Kotlin debuggers to your app.
You don't need VS Code to debug both Dart and Android code.
This guide includes the VS Code instructions to be consistent
with the Xcode and Visual Studio guides.


These section uses the same example Flutter `url_launcher` app created
in [Update test Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#update-test-flutter-app).


#### Build the Android version of the Flutter app in the Terminal

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#build-the-android-version-of-the-flutter-app-in-the-terminal)

To generate the needed Android platform dependencies,
run the `flutter build` command.


```
flutter build appbundle --debug
```

#### Start debugging with VS Code first

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#from-vscode-to-android-studio)

If you use VS Code to debug most of your code, start with this section.

1. To open the Flutter app directory, go to
    **File** > **Open Folder...** and choose the `my_app` directory.

2. Open the `lib/main.dart` file.

3. If you can build an app for more than one device,
    you must select the device first.

Go to
    **View** > **Command Palette...**

You can also press `Ctrl` / `Cmd` +
    `Shift` \+ `P`.

4. Type `flutter select`.

5. Click the **Flutter: Select Device** command.

6. Choose your target device.

7. Click the debug icon
    (![VS Code's bug icon to trigger the debugging mode of a Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/testing/debugging/vscode-ui/icons/debug.png)).
    This opens the **Debug** pane and launches the app.
    Wait for the app to launch on the device and for the debug pane to
    indicate **Connected**.
    The debugger takes longer to launch the first time.
    Subsequent launches start faster.

This Flutter app contains two buttons:
   - **Launch in browser**: This button opens this page in the
      default browser of your device.
   - **Launch in app**: This button opens this page within your app.
      This button only works for iOS or Android. Desktop apps launch a browser.

#### Attach to the Flutter process in Android Studio

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#attach-to-the-flutter-process-in-android-studio)

1. Click the **Attach debugger to Android process** button.
    (![Tiny green bug superimposed with a light grey arrow](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/testing/debugging/native/android-studio/attach-process-button.png))

    :::tip
    If this button doesn't appear in the **Projects** menu bar, verify that
    you opened Flutter _application_ project but _not a Flutter plugin_.
    :::

2. The **process** dialog displays one entry for each connected device.
    Select **show all processes** to display available processes for each
    device.

3. Choose the process to which you want to attach.
    For this guide, select the `com.example.my_app` process
    using the **Emulator Pixel\_5\_API\_33**.

4. Locate the tab for **Android Debugger** in the **Debug** pane.

5. In the **Project** pane, expand
    **my\_app\_android** > **android** > **app** > **src** > **main** > **java** > **io.flutter plugins**.

6. Double click **GeneratedProjectRegistrant** to open the
    Java code in the **Edit** pane.


At the end of this procedure, both the Dart and Android debuggers interact
with the same process.
Use either, or both, to set breakpoints, examine stack, resume execution
and the like. In other words, debug!


#### Start debugging with Android Studio first

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/native-debugging#from-android-studio)

If you use Android Studio to debug most of your code, start with this section.

01. To open the Flutter app directory, go to
     **File** > **Open...** and choose the `my_app` directory.

02. Open the `lib/main.dart` file.

03. Choose a virtual Android device.
     Go to the toolbar, open the leftmost dropdown menu, and click on
     **Open Android Emulator: <device>**.

    You can choose any installed emulator that's doesn't include `arm64`.

04. From that same menu, select the virtual Android device.

05. From the toolbar, click **Run 'main.dart'**.

    You can also press `Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `R`.

    After the app displays in the emulator, continue to the next step.

06. Click the **Attach debugger to Android process** button.
     (![Tiny green bug superimposed with a light grey arrow](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/testing/debugging/native/android-studio/attach-process-button.png))

     :::tip
     If this button doesn't appear in the **Projects** menu bar, verify that
     you opened Flutter _application_ project but _not a Flutter plugin_.
     :::

07. The **process** dialog displays one entry for each connected device.
     Select **show all processes** to display available processes for each
     device.

08. Choose the process to which you want to attach.
     For this guide, select the `com.example.my_app` process
     using the **Emulator Pixel\_5\_API\_33**.

09. Locate the tab for **Android Debugger** in the **Debug** pane.

10. In the **Project** pane, expand
     **my\_app\_android** > **android** > **app** > **src** > **main** > **java** > **io.flutter plugins**.

11. Double click **GeneratedProjectRegistrant** to open the
     Java code in the **Edit** pane.


At the end of this procedure, both the Dart and Android debuggers interact
with the same process.
Use either, or both, to set breakpoints, examine stack, resume execution
and the like. In other words, debug!

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

## Getting started

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#getting-started)

DevTools includes a full source-level debugger,
supporting breakpoints, stepping, and variable inspection.


When you open the debugger tab, you should see the source for the main
entry-point for your app loaded in the debugger.


In order to browse around more of your application sources, click **Libraries**
(top right) or press `Ctrl` / `Cmd` \+ `P`.
This opens the libraries window and allows you
to search for other source files.


![Screenshot of the debugger tab](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/debugger_screenshot.png)

## Setting breakpoints

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#setting-breakpoints)

To set a breakpoint, click the left margin (the line number ruler)
in the source area. Clicking once sets a breakpoint, which should
also show up in the **Breakpoints** area on the left. Clicking
again removes the breakpoint.


## The call stack and variable areas

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#the-call-stack-and-variable-areas)

When your application encounters a breakpoint, it pauses there,
and the DevTools debugger shows the paused execution location
in the source area. In addition, the `Call stack` and `Variables`

areas populate with the current call stack for the paused isolate,
and the local variables for the selected frame. Selecting other
frames in the `Call stack` area changes the contents of the variables.


Within the `Variables` area, you can inspect individual objects by
toggling them open to see their fields. Hovering over an object
in the `Variables` area calls `toString()` for that object and
displays the result.


## Stepping through source code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#stepping-through-source-code)

When paused, the three stepping buttons become active.

- Use **Step in** to step into a method invocation, stopping at
the first executable line in that invoked method.

- Use **Step over** to step over a method invocation;
this steps through source lines in the current method.

- Use **Step out** to step out of the current method,
without stopping at any intermediary lines.


In addition, the **Resume** button continues regular
execution of the application.


## Console output

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#console-output)

Console output for the running app (stdout and stderr) is
displayed in the console, below the source code area.
You can also see the output in the [Logging view](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/logging).


## Breaking on exceptions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#breaking-on-exceptions)

To adjust the stop-on-exceptions behavior, toggle the
**Ignore** dropdown at the top of the debugger view.


Breaking on unhandled excepts only pauses execution if the
breakpoint is considered uncaught by the application code.
Breaking on all exceptions causes the debugger to pause
whether or not the breakpoint was caught by application code.


## Known issues

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#known-issues)

When performing a hot restart for a Flutter application,
user breakpoints are cleared.


## Other resources

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/debugger#other-resources)

[Debugging](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/debugging) page.

To get a better overview of the layout mechanism, start with
[Flutter's approach to layout](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout).


## Diagram the layout

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#diagram-the-layout)

In this section, consider what type of user experience you want for
your app users.


Consider how to position the components of your user interface.
A layout consists of the total end result of these positionings.
Consider planning your layout to speed up your coding.
Using visual cues to know where something goes on screen can be a great help.


Use whichever method you prefer, like an interface design tool or a pencil
and a sheet of paper. Figure out where you want to place elements on your
screen before writing code. It's the programming version of the adage:
"Measure twice, cut once."


1. Ask these questions to break the layout down to its basic elements.

   - Can you identify the rows and columns?
   - Does the layout include a grid?
   - Are there overlapping elements?
   - Does the UI need tabs?
   - What do you need to align, pad, or border?
2. Identify the larger elements. In this example, you arrange the image, title,
buttons, and description into a column.


![Major elements in the layout: image, row, row, and text block](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/layout-sketch-intro.svg)

Major elements in the layout: image, row, row, and text block

3. Diagram each row.

1. Row 1, the **Title** section, has three children:
      a column of text, a star icon, and a number.
      Its first child, the column, contains two lines of text.
      That first column might need more space.


      ![Title section with text blocks and an icon](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/layout-sketch-title-block.svg)

      Title section with text blocks and an icon

2. Row 2, the **Button** section, has three children: each child contains
      a column which then contains an icon and text.


      ![The Button section with three labeled buttons](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/layout-sketch-button-block.svg)

      The Button section with three labeled buttons

After diagramming the layout, consider how you would code it.

Would you write all the code in one class?
Or, would you create one class for each part of the layout?


To follow Flutter best practices, create one class, or Widget,
to contain each part of your layout.
When Flutter needs to re-render part of a UI,
it updates the smallest part that changes.
This is why Flutter makes "everything a widget".
If only the text changes in a `Text` widget, Flutter redraws only that text.
Flutter changes the least amount of the UI possible in response to user input.


For this tutorial, write each element you have identified as its own widget.

## Create the app base code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#create-the-app-base-code)

In this section, shell out the basic Flutter app code to start your app.

1. [Set up your Flutter environment](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started).

2. [Create a new Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/create-new-app).

3. Replace the contents of `lib/main.dart` with the following code.
    This app uses a parameter for the app title and the title shown
    on the app's `appBar`. This decision simplifies the code.



dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());
​
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
     const MyApp({super.key});
​
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       const String appTitle = 'Flutter layout demo';
       return MaterialApp(
         title: appTitle,
         home: Scaffold(
           appBar: AppBar(title: const Text(appTitle)),
           body: const Center(
             child: Text('Hello World'),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
}
```

## Add the Title section

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#add-the-title-section)

In this section, create a `TitleSection` widget that resembles
the following layout.


![The Title section as sketch and prototype UI](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/layout-sketch-title-block-unlabeled.svg)

The Title section as sketch and prototype UI

### Add the `TitleSection` Widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#add-the-titlesection-widget)

Add the following code after the `MyApp` class.

dart

```
class TitleSection extends StatelessWidget {
  const TitleSection({super.key, required this.name, required this.location});
​
  final String name;
  final String location;
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(32),
      child: Row(
        children: [\
          Expanded(\
            /*1*/\
            child: Column(\
              crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,\
              children: [\
                /*2*/\
                Padding(\
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 8),\
                  child: Text(\
                    name,\
                    style: const TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),\
                  ),\
                ),\
                Text(location, style: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey[500])),\
              ],\
            ),\
          ),\
          /*3*/\
          Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.red[500]),\
          const Text('41'),\
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

1. To use all remaining free space in the row, use the `Expanded` widget to
    stretch the `Column` widget.
    To place the column at the start of the row,
    set the `crossAxisAlignment` property to `CrossAxisAlignment.start`.

2. To add space between the rows of text, put those rows in a `Padding` widget.
3. The title row ends with a red star icon and the text `41`.
    The entire row falls inside a `Padding` widget and pads each edge
    by 32 pixels.


### Change the app body to a scrolling view

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#change-the-app-body-to-a-scrolling-view)

In the `body` property, replace the `Center` widget with a
`SingleChildScrollView` widget.
Within the [`SingleChildScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildScrollView-class.html)
widget, replace the `Text` widget with a
`Column` widget.


dart

```
body: const Center(
  child: Text('Hello World'),
body: const SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: [\
```\
\
content\_copy\
\
These code updates change the app in the following ways.\
\
- A `SingleChildScrollView` widget can scroll.\
This allows elements that don't fit on the current screen to display.\
\
- A `Column` widget displays any elements within its `children` property\
in the order listed.\
The first element listed in the `children` list displays at\
the top of the list. Elements in the `children` list display\
in array order on the screen from top to bottom.\
\
\
### Update the app to display the title section\
\
[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#update-the-app-to-display-the-title-section)\
\
Add the `TitleSection` widget as the first element in the `children` list.\
This places it at the top of the screen.\
Pass the provided name and location to the `TitleSection` constructor.\
\
\
dart\
\
```\
children: [\
  TitleSection(\
    name: 'Oeschinen Lake Campground',\
    location: 'Kandersteg, Switzerland',\
  ),\
],\
```\
\
content\_copy\
\
## Add the Button section\
\
[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#add-the-button-section)\
\
In this section, add the buttons that will add functionality to your app.\
\
The **Button** section contains three columns that use the same layout:\
an icon over a row of text.\
\
\
![The Button section as sketch and prototype UI](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/layout-sketch-button-block-unlabeled.svg)\
\
The Button section as sketch and prototype UI\
\
Plan to distribute these columns in one row so each takes the same\
amount of space. Paint all text and icons with the primary color.\
\
\
### Add the `ButtonSection` widget\
\
[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#add-the-buttonsection-widget)\
\
Add the following code after the `TitleSection` widget to contain the code\
to build the row of buttons.\
\
\
dart\
\
```\
class ButtonSection extends StatelessWidget {\
  const ButtonSection({super.key});\
​\
  @override\
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\
    final Color color = Theme.of(context).primaryColor;\
    // ···\
  }\
​\
}\
```\
\
content\_copy\
\
### Create a widget to make buttons\
\
[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#create-a-widget-to-make-buttons)\
\
As the code for each column could use the same syntax,\
create a widget named `ButtonWithText`.\
The widget's constructor accepts a color, icon data, and a label for the button.\
Using these values, the widget builds a `Column` with an `Icon`\
and a stylized\
`Text` widget as its children.\
To help separate these children, a `Padding` widget the `Text`\
widget\
is wrapped with a `Padding` widget.\
\
\
Add the following code after the `ButtonSection` class.\
\
dart\
\
```\
class ButtonSection extends StatelessWidget {\
  const ButtonSection({super.key});\
  // ···\
}\
​\
class ButtonWithText extends StatelessWidget {\
  const ButtonWithText({\
    super.key,\
    required this.color,\
    required this.icon,\
    required this.label,\
  });\
​\
  final Color color;\
  final IconData icon;\
  final String label;\
​\
  @override\
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\
    return Column(\
      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,\
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\
      children: [\
        Icon(icon, color: color),\
        Padding(\
          padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 8),\
          child: Text(\
            label,\
            style: TextStyle(\
              fontSize: 12,\
              fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,\
              color: color,\
            ),\
          ),\
        ),\
      ],\
    );\
  }\
}\
```\
\
content\_copy\
\
### Position the buttons with a `Row` widget\
\
[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#position-the-buttons-with-a-row-widget)\
\
Add the following code into the `ButtonSection` widget.\
\
1. Add three instances of the `ButtonWithText` widget, once for each button.\
2. Pass the color, `Icon`, and text for that specific button.\
3. Align the columns along the main axis with the\
    `MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly` value.\
    The main axis for a `Row` widget is horizontal and the main axis for a\
    `Column` widget is vertical.\
    This value, then, tells Flutter to arrange the free space in equal amounts\
    before, between, and after each column along the `Row`.\
\
\
dart\
\
```\
class ButtonSection extends StatelessWidget {\
  const ButtonSection({super.key});\
​\
  @override\
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\
    final Color color = Theme.of(context).primaryColor;\
    return SizedBox(\
      child: Row(\
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,\
        children: [\
          ButtonWithText(color: color, icon: Icons.call, label: 'CALL'),\
          ButtonWithText(color: color, icon: Icons.near_me, label: 'ROUTE'),\
          ButtonWithText(color: color, icon: Icons.share, label: 'SHARE'),\
        ],\
      ),\
    );\
  }\
​\
}\
​\
class ButtonWithText extends StatelessWidget {\
  const ButtonWithText({\
    super.key,\
    required this.color,\
    required this.icon,\
    required this.label,\
  });\
​\
  final Color color;\
  final IconData icon;\
  final String label;\
​\
  @override\
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\
    return Column(\
      // ···\
    );\
  }\
}\
```\
\
content\_copy\
\
### Update the app to display the button section\
\
[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#update-the-app-to-display-the-button-section)\
\
Add the button section to the `children` list.\
\
dart\
\
```\
  TitleSection(\
    name: 'Oeschinen Lake Campground',\
    location: 'Kandersteg, Switzerland',\
  ),\
  ButtonSection(),\
],
```

content\_copy

## Add the Text section

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#add-the-text-section)

In this section, add the text description to this app.

![The text block as sketch and prototype UI](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/layout-sketch-add-text-block.svg)

The text block as sketch and prototype UI

### Add the `TextSection` widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#add-the-textsection-widget)

Add the following code as a separate widget after the `ButtonSection` widget.

dart

```
class TextSection extends StatelessWidget {
  const TextSection({super.key, required this.description});
​
  final String description;
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(32),
      child: Text(description, softWrap: true),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

By setting [`softWrap`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text/softWrap.html)
to `true`, text lines fill the column width before
wrapping at a word boundary.


### Update the app to display the text section

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#update-the-app-to-display-the-text-section)

Add a new `TextSection` widget as a child after the `ButtonSection`.
When adding the `TextSection` widget, set its `description` property to
the text of the location description.


dart

```
    location: 'Kandersteg, Switzerland',
  ),
  ButtonSection(),
  TextSection(
    description:
        'Lake Oeschinen lies at the foot of the Blüemlisalp in the '
        'Bernese Alps. Situated 1,578 meters above sea level, it '
        'is one of the larger Alpine Lakes. A gondola ride from '
        'Kandersteg, followed by a half-hour walk through pastures '
        'and pine forest, leads you to the lake, which warms to 20 '
        'degrees Celsius in the summer. Activities enjoyed here '
        'include rowing, and riding the summer toboggan run.',
  ),
],
```

content\_copy

## Add the Image section

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#add-the-image-section)

In this section, add the image file to complete your layout.

### Configure your app to use supplied images

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#configure-your-app-to-use-supplied-images)

To configure your app to reference images, modify its `pubspec.yaml` file.

1. Create an `images` directory at the top of the project.

2. Download the [`lake.jpg`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/website/main/examples/layout/lakes/step5/images/lake.jpg)
    image and add it to the new `images` directory.

3. To include images, add an `assets` tag to the `pubspec.yaml` file
    at the root directory of your app.
    When you add `assets`, it serves as the set of pointers to the images
    available to your code.



pubspec.yaml



yaml

```
flutter:
     uses-material-design: true
     assets:
    - images/lake.jpg
```

content\_copy

### Create the `ImageSection` widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#create-the-imagesection-widget)

Define the following `ImageSection` widget after the other declarations.

dart

```
class ImageSection extends StatelessWidget {
const ImageSection({super.key, required this.image});
​
final String image;
​
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Image.asset(image, width: 600, height: 240, fit: BoxFit.cover);
}
}
```

content\_copy

The `BoxFit.cover` value tells Flutter to display the image with
two constraints. First, display the image as small as possible.
Second, cover all the space that the layout allotted, called the render box.


### Update the app to display the image section

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#update-the-app-to-display-the-image-section)

Add an `ImageSection` widget as the first child in the `children` list.
Set the `image` property to the path of the image you added in
[Configure your app to use supplied images](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial#configure-your-app-to-use-supplied-images).


dart

```
children: [\
ImageSection(\
    image: 'images/lake.jpg',\
),\
TitleSection(\
    name: 'Oeschinen Lake Campground',\
    location: 'Kandersteg, Switzerland',\
```\
\

[vertical\_align\_topFlutter architectural overview](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This article is intended to provide a high-level overview of the architecture of
Flutter, including the core principles and concepts that form its design.
If you are interested in how to architect a Flutter app,
check out [Architecting Flutter apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture).


Flutter is a cross-platform UI toolkit that is designed to allow code reuse
across operating systems such as iOS, Android, web, and desktop,
while also allowing
applications to interface directly with underlying platform services.
The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps
that feel natural on different platforms,
embracing differences where they exist while sharing as
much code as possible.


During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers
stateful hot reload of changes without needing a full recompile.
For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code,
whether Intel x64 or ARM instructions,
or to JavaScript if targeting the web.
The framework is open source, with a permissive BSD license,
and has a thriving ecosystem of third-party packages that
supplement the core library functionality.


This overview is divided into a number of sections:

1. The **layer model**: The pieces from which Flutter is constructed.
2. **Reactive user interfaces**: A core concept for Flutter user interface
    development.

3. An introduction to **widgets**: The fundamental building blocks
    of Flutter user interfaces.

4. The **rendering process**: How Flutter turns UI code into pixels.
5. An overview of the **platform embedders**: The code that lets mobile and
    desktop OSes execute Flutter apps.

6. **Integrating Flutter with other code**: Information about
    different techniques available to Flutter apps.

7. **Support for the web**: Concluding remarks about the characteristics of
    Flutter in a browser environment.


## Architectural layers

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#architectural-layers)

Flutter is designed as an extensible, layered system. It exists as a series of
independent libraries that each depend on the underlying layer. No layer has
privileged access to the layer below, and every part of the framework level is
designed to be optional and replaceable.


![Architectural diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/archdiagram.png)

To the underlying operating system, Flutter applications are packaged in the
same way as any other native application. A platform-specific embedder provides
an entrypoint; coordinates with the underlying operating system for access to
services like rendering surfaces, accessibility, and input; and manages the
message event loop. The embedder is written in a language that is appropriate
for the platform: currently Java and C++ for Android, Swift and
Objective-C/Objective-C++ for iOS and macOS,
and C++ for Windows and Linux. Using the embedder, Flutter
code can be integrated into an existing application as a module,
or the code might be the entire content of the application.
Flutter includes a number of embedders
for common target platforms, but other embedders also
exist.


At the core of Flutter is the **Flutter engine**,
which is mostly written in C++ and supports
the primitives necessary to support all Flutter applications.
The engine is responsible for rasterizing composited scenes
whenever a new frame needs to be painted.
It provides the low-level implementation of Flutter's core API,
including graphics text layout, file and network I/O, a Dart runtime,
and compile toolchain.


The engine is exposed to the Flutter framework through
[`dart:ui`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine/src/flutter/lib/ui),
which wraps the underlying C++ code in Dart classes. This library
exposes the lowest-level primitives, such as classes for driving input,
graphics, and text rendering subsystems.


Typically, developers interact with Flutter through the **Flutter framework**,
which provides a modern, reactive framework written in the Dart language. It
includes a rich set of platform, layout, and foundational libraries, composed of
a series of layers. Working from the bottom to the top, we have:


- Basic **[foundational](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/foundation-library.html)**

classes, and building block services such as
**[animation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/animation-library.html),**
**[painting](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/painting-library.html), and**
**[gestures](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/gestures-library.html)**
that offer
commonly used abstractions over the underlying foundation.

- The **[rendering\**\
**layer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/rendering-library.html)** provides an
abstraction for dealing with layout. With this layer, you can build a tree of
renderable objects. You can manipulate these objects dynamically, with the
tree automatically updating the layout to reflect your changes.

- The **[widgets layer](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/widgets-library.html)**
is
a composition abstraction. Each render object in the rendering layer has a
corresponding class in the widgets layer. In addition, the widgets layer
allows you to define combinations of classes that you can reuse. This is the
layer at which the reactive programming model is introduced.

- The
**[Material](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html)**

and
**[Cupertino](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/cupertino-library.html)**

libraries offer comprehensive sets of controls that use the widget layer's
composition primitives to implement the Material or iOS design languages.


The Flutter framework is relatively small; many higher-level features that
developers might use are implemented as packages, including platform plugins
like [camera](https://pub.dev/packages/camera) and
[webview](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter), as well as platform-agnostic
features like [characters](https://pub.dev/packages/characters),
[http](https://pub.dev/packages/http), and
[animations](https://pub.dev/packages/animations) that build upon the core Dart and
Flutter libraries. Some of these packages come from the broader ecosystem,
covering services like [in-app\\
payments](https://pub.dev/packages/square_in_app_payments), [Apple\\
authentication](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple), and
[animations](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie).


The rest of this overview broadly navigates down the layers, starting with the
reactive paradigm of UI development. Then, we describe how widgets are composed
together and converted into objects that can be rendered as part of an
application. We describe how Flutter interoperates with other code at a platform
level, before giving a brief summary of how Flutter's web support differs from
other targets.


## Anatomy of an app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#anatomy-of-an-app)

The following diagram gives an overview of the pieces
that make up a regular Flutter app generated by `flutter create`.
It shows where the Flutter Engine sits in this stack,
highlights API boundaries, and identifies the repositories
where the individual pieces live. The legend below clarifies
some of the terminology commonly used to describe the
pieces of a Flutter app.


![The layers of a Flutter app created by "flutter create": Dart app, framework, engine, embedder, runner](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/app-anatomy.svg)

**Dart App**

- Composes widgets into the desired UI.

(for example, widgets, hit-testing, gesture detection,
accessibility, text input).

- Composites the app's widget tree into a scene.

**Engine** ( [source code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine/src/flutter/shell/common))


- Responsible for rasterizing composited scenes.
- Provides low-level implementation of Flutter's core APIs
(for example, graphics, text layout, Dart runtime).

- Exposes its functionality to the framework using the **dart:ui API**.
- Integrates with a specific platform using the Engine's **Embedder API**.

**Embedder** ( [source code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform))


- Coordinates with the underlying operating system
for access to services like rendering surfaces,
accessibility, and input.

- Manages the event loop.
- Exposes **platform-specific API** to integrate the Embedder into apps.

**Runner**

- Composes the pieces exposed by the platform-specific
API of the Embedder into an app package runnable on the target platform.

- Part of app template generated by `flutter create`,
owned by app developer.


## Reactive user interfaces

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#reactive-user-interfaces)

On the surface, Flutter is [a reactive, declarative UI framework](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq#what-programming-paradigm-does-flutters-framework-use),
in which the developer provides a mapping from application state to interface
state, and the framework takes on the task of updating the interface at runtime
when the application state changes. This model is inspired by
[work that came from Facebook for their own React framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=x7cQ3mrcKaY&feature=emb_logo),
which includes a rethinking of many traditional design principles.


In most traditional UI frameworks, the user interface's initial state is
described once and then separately updated by user code at runtime, in response
to events. One challenge of this approach is that, as the application grows in
complexity, the developer needs to be aware of how state changes cascade
throughout the entire UI. For example, consider the following UI:


![Color picker dialog](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/color-picker.png)

There are many places where the state can be changed: the color box, the hue
slider, the radio buttons. As the user interacts with the UI, changes must be
reflected in every other place. Worse, unless care is taken, a minor change to
one part of the user interface can cause ripple effects to seemingly unrelated
pieces of code.


One solution to this is an approach like MVC, where you push data changes to the
model through the controller, and then the model pushes the new state to the view
through the controller. However, this also is problematic, since creating and
updating UI elements are two separate steps that can easily get out of sync.


Flutter, along with other reactive frameworks, takes an alternative approach to
this problem, by explicitly decoupling the user interface from its underlying
state. With React-style APIs, you only create the UI description, and the
framework takes care of using that one configuration to both create and/or
update the user interface as appropriate.


In Flutter, widgets (akin to components in React) are represented by immutable
classes that are used to configure a tree of objects. These widgets are used to
manage a separate tree of objects for layout, which is then used to manage a
separate tree of objects for compositing. Flutter is, at its core, a series of
mechanisms for efficiently walking the modified parts of trees, converting trees
of objects into lower-level trees of objects, and propagating changes across
these trees.


A widget declares its user interface by overriding the `build()` method, which
is a function that converts state to UI:


```
UI = f(state)
```

content\_copy

The `build()` method is by design fast to execute and should be free of side
effects, allowing it to be called by the framework whenever needed (potentially
as often as once per rendered frame).


This approach relies on certain characteristics of a language runtime (in
particular, fast object instantiation and deletion). Fortunately, [Dart is\\
particularly well suited for this\\
task](https://blog.flutter.dev/flutter-dont-fear-the-garbage-collector-d69b3ff1ca30).


## Widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#widgets)

As mentioned, Flutter emphasizes widgets as a unit of composition. Widgets are
the building blocks of a Flutter app's user interface, and each widget is an
immutable declaration of part of the user interface.


Widgets form a hierarchy based on composition. Each widget nests inside its
parent and can receive context from the parent. This structure carries all the
way up to the root widget (the container that hosts the Flutter app, typically
`MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp`), as this trivial example shows:


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
​
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());
​
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('My Home Page')),
        body: Center(
          child: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              return Column(
                children: [\
                  const Text('Hello World'),\
                  const SizedBox(height: 20),\
                  ElevatedButton(\
                    onPressed: () {\
                      print('Click!');\
                    },\
                    child: const Text('A button'),\
                  ),\
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

In the preceding code, all instantiated classes are widgets.

Apps update their user interface in response to events (such as a user
interaction) by telling the framework to replace a widget in the hierarchy with
another widget. The framework then compares the new and old widgets, and
efficiently updates the user interface.


Flutter has its own implementations of each UI control, rather than deferring to
those provided by the system: for example, there is a pure [Dart\\
implementation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoSwitch-class.html)
of both the [iOS Toggle\\
control](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/toggles)
and the [one for](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Switch-class.html)
the
[Android equivalent](https://m3.material.io/components/switch).


This approach provides several benefits:

- Provides for unlimited extensibility. A developer who wants a variant of the
Switch control can create one in any arbitrary way, and is not limited to the
extension points provided by the OS.

- Avoids a significant performance bottleneck by allowing Flutter to composite
the entire scene at once, without transitioning back and forth between Flutter
code and platform code.

- Decouples the application behavior from any operating system dependencies. The
application looks and feels the same on all versions of the OS, even if the OS
changed the implementations of its controls.


### Composition

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#composition)

Widgets are typically composed of many other small, single-purpose widgets that
combine to produce powerful effects.


Where possible, the number of design concepts is kept to a minimum while
allowing the total vocabulary to be large. For example, in the widgets layer,
Flutter uses the same core concept (a `Widget`) to represent drawing to the
screen, layout (positioning and sizing), user interactivity, state management,
theming, animations, and navigation. In the animation layer, a pair of concepts,
`Animation`s and `Tween`s, cover most of the design space. In the rendering
layer, `RenderObject`s are used to describe layout, painting, hit testing, and
accessibility. In each of these cases, the corresponding vocabulary ends up
being large: there are hundreds of widgets and render objects, and dozens of
animation and tween types.


The class hierarchy is deliberately shallow and broad to maximize the possible
number of combinations, focusing on small, composable widgets that each do one
thing well. Core features are abstract, with even basic features like padding
and alignment being implemented as separate components rather than being built
into the core. (This also contrasts with more traditional APIs where features
like padding are built in to the common core of every layout component.) So, for
example, to center a widget, rather than adjusting a notional `Align` property,
you wrap it in a [`Center`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html)

widget.


There are widgets for padding, alignment, rows, columns, and grids. These layout
widgets do not have a visual representation of their own. Instead, their sole
purpose is to control some aspect of another widget's layout. Flutter also
includes utility widgets that take advantage of this compositional approach.


For example, [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html), a
commonly used widget, is made up of several widgets responsible for layout,
painting, positioning, and sizing. Specifically, `Container` is made up of the
[`LimitedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LimitedBox-class.html),
[`ConstrainedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ConstrainedBox-class.html),
[`Align`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Align-class.html),
[`Padding`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Padding-class.html),
[`DecoratedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DecoratedBox-class.html), and
[`Transform`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Transform-class.html)
widgets, as you
can see by reading its source code. A defining characteristic of Flutter is that
you can drill down into the source for any widget and examine it. So, rather
than subclassing `Container` to produce a customized effect, you can compose it
and other widgets in novel ways, or just create a new widget using
`Container` as inspiration.


### Building widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#building-widgets)

As mentioned earlier, you determine the visual representation of a widget by
overriding the
[`build()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html)
function to
return a new element tree. This tree represents the widget's part of the user
interface in more concrete terms. For example, a toolbar widget might have a
build function that returns a [horizontal\\
layout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html) of some
[text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) and
[various](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html) [buttons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/PopupMenuButton-class.html). As needed,
the framework recursively asks each widget to build until the tree is entirely
described by [concrete renderable\\
objects](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RenderObjectWidget-class.html). The
framework then stitches together the renderable objects into a renderable object
tree.


A widget's build function should be free of side effects. Whenever the function
is asked to build, the widget should return a new tree of widgets[1](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fn-1),
regardless of what the widget previously returned. The
framework does the heavy lifting work to determine which build methods need to
be called based on the render object tree (described in more detail later). More
information about this process can be found in the [Inside Flutter\\
topic](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter#linear-reconciliation).


On each rendered frame, Flutter can recreate just the parts of the UI where the
state has changed by calling that widget's `build()` method. Therefore it is
important that build methods should return quickly, and heavy computational work
should be done in some asynchronous manner and then stored as part of the state
to be used by a build method.


While relatively naive in approach, this automated comparison is quite
effective, enabling high-performance, interactive apps. And, the design of the
build function simplifies your code by focusing on declaring what a widget is
made of, rather than the complexities of updating the user interface from one
state to another.


### Widget state

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#widget-state)

The framework introduces two major classes of widget: _stateful_ and _stateless_
widgets.


Many widgets have no mutable state: they don't have any properties that change
over time (for example, an icon or a label). These widgets subclass
[`StatelessWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html).


However, if the unique characteristics of a widget needs to change based on user
interaction or other factors, that widget is _stateful_. For example, if a
widget has a counter that increments whenever the user taps a button, then the
value of the counter is the state for that widget. When that value changes, the
widget needs to be rebuilt to update its part of the UI. These widgets subclass
[`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html), and
(because the widget itself is immutable) they store mutable state in a separate
class that subclasses [`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html).
`StatefulWidget`s don't have a build method; instead, their user interface is
built through their `State` object.


Whenever you mutate a `State` object (for example, by incrementing the counter),
you must call [`setState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html)

to signal the framework to update the user interface by calling the `State`'s
build method again.


Having separate state and widget objects lets other widgets treat both stateless
and stateful widgets in exactly the same way, without being concerned about
losing state. Instead of needing to hold on to a child to preserve its state,
the parent can create a new instance of the child at any time without losing the
child's persistent state. The framework does all the work of finding and reusing
existing state objects when appropriate.


### State management

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#state-management)

So, if many widgets can contain state, how is state managed and passed around
the system?


As with any other class,
you can use a constructor in a widget to initialize its data,
so a `build()` method can ensure that any child widget
is instantiated with the data it needs:


dart

```
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   return ContentWidget(importantState);
}
```

content\_copy

Where `importantState` is a placeholder for the class
that contains the state important to the `Widget`.


As widget trees get deeper, however,
passing state information up and down the
tree hierarchy becomes cumbersome.
So, a third widget type, [`InheritedWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html),
provides an easy way to grab data from a shared ancestor.
You can use `InheritedWidget` to create a state widget
that wraps a common ancestor in the
widget tree, as shown in this example:


![Inherited widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/inherited-widget.png)

Whenever one of the `ExamWidget` or `GradeWidget` objects needs data from
`StudentState`, it can now access it with a command such as:


dart

```
final studentState = StudentState.of(context);
```

content\_copy

The `of(context)` call takes the build context
(a handle to the current widget location),
and returns [the nearest ancestor in the tree](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext/dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType.html)

that matches the `StudentState` type.
`InheritedWidget`s also offer an `updateShouldNotify()` method,
which Flutter calls to determine whether a state
change should trigger a rebuild of child widgets that use it.


Flutter itself uses `InheritedWidget` extensively as part
of the framework for shared state,
such as the application's _visual theme_, which includes
[properties like color and type styles](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html)
that are
pervasive throughout an application.
The `MaterialApp``build()` method inserts a theme
in the tree when it builds, and then deeper in the hierarchy a widget
can use the `.of()` method to look up the relevant theme data.


For example:

dart

```
Container(
  color: Theme.of(context).secondaryHeaderColor,
  child: Text(
    'Text with a background color',
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge,
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

As applications grow, more advanced state management approaches that reduce the
ceremony of creating and using stateful widgets become more attractive. Many
Flutter apps use utility packages like
[provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), which provides a wrapper around
`InheritedWidget`. Flutter's layered architecture also enables alternative
approaches to implement the transformation of state into UI, such as the
[flutter\_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) package.


## Rendering and layout

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#rendering-and-layout)

This section describes the rendering pipeline, which is the series of steps that
Flutter takes to convert a hierarchy of widgets into the actual pixels painted
onto a screen.


### Flutter's rendering model

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#flutters-rendering-model)

You might be wondering: if Flutter is a cross-platform framework,
then how can it offer comparable performance to
single-platform frameworks?


It's useful to start by thinking about how traditional
Android apps work. When drawing,
you first call the Java code of the Android framework.
The Android system libraries provide the components
responsible for drawing themselves to a `Canvas` object,
which Android can then render with [Skia](https://skia.org/),
a graphics engine written in C/C++ that calls the
CPU or GPU to complete the drawing on the device.


Cross-platform frameworks _typically_ work by creating
an abstraction layer over the underlying native
Android and iOS UI libraries, attempting to smooth out the
inconsistencies of each platform representation.
App code is often written in an interpreted language like JavaScript,
which must in turn interact with the Java-based
Android or Objective-C-based iOS system libraries to display UI.
All this adds overhead that can be significant,
particularly where there is a lot of
interaction between the UI and the app logic.


By contrast, Flutter minimizes those abstractions,
bypassing the system UI widget libraries in favor
of its own widget set. The Dart code that paints
Flutter's visuals is compiled into native code,
which uses Impeller for rendering.
Impeller is shipped along with the application,
allowing the developer to upgrade their app to stay
updated with the latest performance improvements
even if the phone hasn't been updated with a new Android version.
The same is true for Flutter on other native platforms,
such as Windows or macOS.


### From user input to the GPU

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#from-user-input-to-the-gpu)

The overriding principle that Flutter applies to its
rendering pipeline is that **simple is fast**.
Flutter has a straightforward pipeline for how data flows to
the system, as shown in the following sequencing diagram:


![Render pipeline sequencing diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/render-pipeline.png)

Let's take a look at some of these phases in greater detail.

### Build: from Widget to Element

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#build-from-widget-to-element)

Consider this code fragment that demonstrates a widget hierarchy:

dart

```
Container(
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Row(
    children: [\
      Image.network('https://www.example.com/1.png'),\
      const Text('A'),\
    ],
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

When Flutter needs to render this fragment,
it calls the `build()` method, which
returns a subtree of widgets that renders
UI-based on the current app state.
During this process,
the `build()` method can introduce new widgets,
as necessary, based on its state.
As an example, in the preceding code fragment,
`Container` has `color` and `child` properties.
From looking at the [source\\
code](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/02efffc134ab4ce4ff50a9ddd86c832efdb80462/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/container.dart#L401)
for `Container`, you can see that if the color is not null,
it inserts a `ColoredBox` representing the color:


dart

```
if (color != null)
  current = ColoredBox(color: color!, child: current);
```

content\_copy

Correspondingly, the `Image` and `Text` widgets might insert child widgets such
as `RawImage` and `RichText` during the build process. The eventual widget
hierarchy might therefore be deeper than what the code represents,
as in this case[2](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fn-2):


![Render pipeline sequencing diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/widgets.png)

This explains why, when you examine the tree through
a debug tool such as the
[Flutter inspector](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/inspector),
part of the Flutter/Dart DevTools,
you might see a structure that is considerably deeper than what
is in your original code.


During the build phase, Flutter translates the widgets expressed in code into a
corresponding **element tree**, with one element for every widget. Each element
represents a specific instance of a widget in a given location of the tree
hierarchy. There are two basic types of elements:


- `ComponentElement`, a host for other elements.
- `RenderObjectElement`, an element that participates in the layout or paint
phases.


![Render pipeline sequencing diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/widget-element.png)

`RenderObjectElement`s are an intermediary between their widget analog and the
underlying `RenderObject`, which we'll come to later.


The element for any widget can be referenced through its `BuildContext`, which
is a handle to the location of a widget in the tree. This is the `context`
in a
function call such as `Theme.of(context)`, and is supplied to the `build()`

method as a parameter.


Because widgets are immutable, including the parent/child relationship between
nodes, any change to the widget tree (such as changing `Text('A')` to
`Text('B')` in the preceding example) causes a new set of widget objects to be
returned. But that doesn't mean the underlying representation must be rebuilt.
The element tree is persistent from frame to frame, and therefore plays a
critical performance role, allowing Flutter to act as if the widget hierarchy is
fully disposable while caching its underlying representation. By only walking
through the widgets that changed, Flutter can rebuild just the parts of the
element tree that require reconfiguration.


### Layout and rendering

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#layout-and-rendering)

It would be a rare application that drew only a single widget. An important part
of any UI framework is therefore the ability to efficiently lay out a hierarchy
of widgets, determining the size and position of each element before they are
rendered on the screen.


The base class for every node in the render tree is
[`RenderObject`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html), which
defines an abstract model for layout and painting. This is extremely general: it
does not commit to a fixed number of dimensions or even a Cartesian coordinate
system (demonstrated by [this example of a polar coordinate\\
system](https://dartpad.dev/?id=596b1d6331e3b9d7b00420085fab3e27)). Each
`RenderObject` knows its parent, but knows little about its children other than
how to _visit_ them and their constraints. This provides `RenderObject`
with
sufficient abstraction to be able to handle a variety of use cases.


During the build phase, Flutter creates or updates an object that inherits from
`RenderObject` for each `RenderObjectElement` in the element tree.
`RenderObject`s are primitives:
[`RenderParagraph`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderParagraph-class.html)

renders text,
[`RenderImage`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderImage-class.html)
renders
an image, and
[`RenderTransform`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderTransform-class.html)

applies a transformation before painting its child.


![Differences between the widgets hierarchy and the element and render trees](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/trees.png)

Most Flutter widgets are rendered by an object that inherits from the
`RenderBox` subclass, which represents a `RenderObject` of fixed size in a 2D
Cartesian space. `RenderBox` provides the basis of a _box constraint model_,
establishing a minimum and maximum width and height for each widget to be
rendered.


To perform layout, Flutter walks the render tree in a depth-first traversal and
**passes down size constraints** from parent to child. In determining its size,
the child _must_ respect the constraints given to it by its parent. Children
respond by **passing up a size** to their parent object within the constraints
the parent established.


![Constraints go down, sizes go up](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/constraints-sizes.png)

At the end of this single walk through the tree, every object has a defined size
within its parent's constraints and is ready to be painted by calling the
[`paint()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject/paint.html)

method.


The box constraint model is very powerful as a way to layout objects in _O(n)_
time:


- Parents can dictate the size of a child object by setting maximum and minimum
constraints to the same value. For example, the topmost render object in a
phone app constrains its child to be the size of the screen. (Children can
choose how to use that space. For example, they might just center what they
want to render within the dictated constraints.)

- A parent can dictate the child's width but give the child flexibility over
height (or dictate height but offer flexibility over width). A real-world example
is flow text, which might have to fit a horizontal constraint but vary
vertically depending on the quantity of text.


This model works even when a child object needs to know how much space it has
available to decide how it will render its content. By using a
[`LayoutBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html)
widget,
the child object can examine the passed-down constraints and use those to
determine how it will use them, for example:


dart

```
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (context, constraints) {
      if (constraints.maxWidth < 600) {
        return const OneColumnLayout();
      } else {
        return const TwoColumnLayout();
      }
    },
  );
}
```

More information about the constraint and layout system,
along with working examples, can be found in the
[Understanding constraints](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/constraints) topic.


The root of all `RenderObject`s is the `RenderView`, which represents the total
output of the render tree. When the platform demands a new frame to be rendered
(for example, because of a
[vsync](https://source.android.com/devices/graphics/implement-vsync) or because
a texture decompression/upload is complete), a call is made to the
`compositeFrame()` method, which is part of the `RenderView`
object at the root
of the render tree. This creates a `SceneBuilder` to trigger an update of the
scene. When the scene is complete, the `RenderView` object passes the composited
scene to the `Window.render()` method in `dart:ui`, which passes control to the
GPU to render it.


Further details of the composition and rasterization stages of the pipeline are
beyond the scope of this high-level article, but more information can be found
[in this talk on the Flutter rendering\\
pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUfXWzp0-DU).


## Platform embedding

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#platform-embedding)

As we've seen, rather than being translated into the equivalent OS widgets,
Flutter user interfaces are built, laid out, composited, and painted by Flutter
itself. The mechanism for obtaining the texture and participating in the app
lifecycle of the underlying operating system inevitably varies depending on the
unique concerns of that platform. The engine is platform-agnostic,
presenting a [stable ABI (Application Binary Interface)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/embedder/embedder.h).
that provides a _platform embedder_ with a way to set up and use Flutter.


The platform embedder is the native OS application that hosts all Flutter
content, and acts as the glue between the host operating system and Flutter.
When you start a Flutter app, the embedder provides the entrypoint,
initializes the Flutter engine, obtains threads for UI and rastering,
and creates a texture that Flutter can write to.
The embedder is also responsible for the app lifecycle,
including input gestures (such as mouse, keyboard, touch), window
sizing, thread management, and platform messages.
Flutter includes platform embedders for Android, iOS, Windows,
macOS, and Linux; you can also create a
custom platform embedder, as in [this worked\\
example](https://github.com/chinmaygarde/fluttercast) that supports remoting
Flutter sessions through a VNC-style framebuffer or [this worked example for\\
Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi).


Each platform has its own set of APIs and constraints. Some brief
platform-specific notes:


- As of Flutter 3.29, the UI and platform threads are merged on
iOS and Android. Specifically, the UI thread
is removed and the Dart code runs on the native platform thread.
For more information, see [The great thread merge](https://youtu.be/miW7vCmQwnw?si=9EYvRDxtkpkPrcSO)
video.

- On iOS and macOS, Flutter is loaded into the embedder as a `UIViewController`
or `NSViewController`, respectively. The platform embedder creates a
`FlutterEngine`, which serves as a host to the Dart VM and your Flutter
runtime, and a `FlutterViewController`, which attaches to the `FlutterEngine`

to pass UIKit or Cocoa input events into Flutter and to display frames
rendered by the `FlutterEngine` using Metal or OpenGL.

- On Android, Flutter is, by default, loaded into the embedder as an `Activity`.
The view is controlled by a
[`FlutterView`](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/embedding/android/FlutterView.html),
which renders Flutter content either as a view or a texture, depending on the
composition and z-ordering requirements of the Flutter content.

- On Windows, Flutter is hosted in a traditional Win32 app, and content is
rendered using
[ANGLE](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/master/README.md), a
library that translates OpenGL API calls to the DirectX 11 equivalents.


## Integrating with other code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#integrating-with-other-code)

Flutter provides a variety of interoperability mechanisms, whether you're
accessing code or APIs written in a language like Kotlin or Swift, calling a
native C-based API, embedding native controls in a Flutter app, or embedding
Flutter in an existing application.


### Platform channels

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#platform-channels)

For mobile and desktop apps, Flutter allows you to call into custom code through
a _platform channel_, which is a mechanism for communicating between your
Dart code and the platform-specific code of your host app. By creating a common
channel (encapsulating a name and a codec), you can send and receive messages
between Dart and a platform component written in a language like Kotlin or
Swift. Data is serialized from a Dart type like `Map` into a standard format,
and then deserialized into an equivalent representation in Kotlin (such as
`HashMap`) or Swift (such as `Dictionary`).


![How platform channels allow Flutter to communicate with host code](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/platform-channels.png)

The following is a short platform channel example of a Dart call to a receiving
event handler in Kotlin (Android) or Swift (iOS):


dart

```
// Dart side
const channel = MethodChannel('foo');
final greeting = await channel.invokeMethod('bar', 'world') as String;
print(greeting);
```

content\_copy

kotlin

```
// Android (Kotlin)
val channel = MethodChannel(flutterView, "foo")
channel.setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->
  when (call.method) {
    "bar" -> result.success("Hello, ${call.arguments}")
    else -> result.notImplemented()
  }
}
```

content\_copy

swift

```
// iOS (Swift)
let channel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: "foo", binaryMessenger: flutterView)
channel.setMethodCallHandler {
  (call: FlutterMethodCall, result: FlutterResult) -> Void in
  switch (call.method) {
    case "bar": result("Hello, \(call.arguments as! String)")
    default: result(FlutterMethodNotImplemented)
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Further examples of using platform channels, including examples for desktop
platforms, can be found in the [flutter/packages](https://github.com/flutter/packages)

repository. There are also [thousands of plugins\\
already available](https://pub.dev/flutter) for Flutter that cover many common
scenarios, ranging from Firebase to ads to device hardware like camera and
Bluetooth.


### Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#foreign-function-interface-ffi)

For C-based APIs, including those that can be generated for code written in
modern languages like Rust or Go, Dart provides a direct mechanism for binding
to native code using the `dart:ffi` library. The foreign function interface
(FFI) model can be considerably faster than platform channels, because no
serialization is required to pass data. Instead, the Dart runtime provides the
ability to allocate memory on the heap that is backed by a Dart object and make
calls to statically or dynamically linked libraries. FFI is available for all
platforms other than web, where the [JS interop libraries](https://dart.dev/interop/js-interop)
and
[`package:web`](https://pub.dev/packages/web) serve a similar purpose.


To use FFI, you create a `typedef` for each of the Dart and unmanaged method
signatures, and instruct the Dart VM to map between them. As an example,
here's a fragment of code to call the traditional Win32 `MessageBox()` API:


dart

```
import 'dart:ffi';
import 'package:ffi/ffi.dart'; // contains .toNativeUtf16() extension method
​
typedef MessageBoxNative =
    Int32 Function(
      IntPtr hWnd,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpText,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpCaption,
      Int32 uType,
    );
​
typedef MessageBoxDart =
    int Function(
      int hWnd,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpText,
      Pointer<Utf16> lpCaption,
      int uType,
    );
​
void exampleFfi() {
  final user32 = DynamicLibrary.open('user32.dll');
  final messageBox = user32.lookupFunction<MessageBoxNative, MessageBoxDart>(
    'MessageBoxW',
  );
​
  final result = messageBox(
    0, // No owner window
    'Test message'.toNativeUtf16(), // Message
    'Window caption'.toNativeUtf16(), // Window title
    0, // OK button only
  );
}
```

### Rendering native controls in a Flutter app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#rendering-native-controls-in-a-flutter-app)

Because Flutter content is drawn to a texture and its widget tree is entirely
internal, there's no place for something like an Android view to exist within
Flutter's internal model or render interleaved within Flutter widgets. That's a
problem for developers that would like to include existing platform components
in their Flutter apps, such as a browser control.


Flutter solves this by introducing platform view widgets
( [`AndroidView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AndroidView-class.html)

and [`UiKitView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/UiKitView-class.html))
that let you embed this kind of content on each platform. Platform views can be
integrated with other Flutter content[3](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fn-3). Each of
these widgets acts as an intermediary to the underlying operating system. For
example, on Android, `AndroidView` serves three primary functions:


- Making a copy of the graphics texture rendered by the native view and
presenting it to Flutter for composition as part of a Flutter-rendered surface
each time the frame is painted.

- Responding to hit testing and input gestures, and translating those into the
equivalent native input.

- Creating an analog of the accessibility tree, and passing commands and
responses between the native and Flutter layers.


Inevitably, there is a certain amount of overhead associated with this
synchronization. In general, therefore, this approach is best suited for complex
controls like Google Maps where reimplementing in Flutter isn't practical.


Typically, a Flutter app instantiates these widgets in a `build()` method based
on a platform test. As an example, from the
[google\_maps\_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) plugin:


dart

```
if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android) {
  return AndroidView(
    viewType: 'plugins.flutter.io/google_maps',
    onPlatformViewCreated: onPlatformViewCreated,
    gestureRecognizers: gestureRecognizers,
    creationParams: creationParams,
    creationParamsCodec: const StandardMessageCodec(),
  );
} else if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS) {
  return UiKitView(
    viewType: 'plugins.flutter.io/google_maps',
    onPlatformViewCreated: onPlatformViewCreated,
    gestureRecognizers: gestureRecognizers,
    creationParams: creationParams,
    creationParamsCodec: const StandardMessageCodec(),
  );
}
return Text(
  '$defaultTargetPlatform is not yet supported by the maps plugin',
);
```

content\_copy

Communicating with the native code underlying the `AndroidView` or `UiKitView`
typically occurs using the platform channels mechanism, as previously described.


At present, platform views aren't available for desktop platforms, but this is
not an architectural limitation; support might be added in the future.


### Hosting Flutter content in a parent app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#hosting-flutter-content-in-a-parent-app)

The converse of the preceding scenario is embedding a Flutter widget in an
existing Android or iOS app. As described in an earlier section, a newly created
Flutter app running on a mobile device is hosted in an Android activity or iOS
`UIViewController`. Flutter content can be embedded into an existing Android or
iOS app using the same embedding API.


The Flutter module template is designed for easy embedding; you can either embed
it as a source dependency into an existing Gradle or Xcode build definition, or
you can compile it into an Android Archive or iOS Framework binary for use
without requiring every developer to have Flutter installed.


The Flutter engine takes a short while to initialize, because it needs to load
Flutter shared libraries, initialize the Dart runtime, create and run a Dart
isolate, and attach a rendering surface to the UI. To minimize any UI delays
when presenting Flutter content, it's best to initialize the Flutter engine
during the overall app initialization sequence, or at least ahead of the first
Flutter screen, so that users don't experience a sudden pause while the first
Flutter code is loaded. In addition, separating the Flutter engine allows it to
be reused across multiple Flutter screens and share the memory overhead involved
with loading the necessary libraries.


More information about how Flutter is loaded into an existing Android or iOS app
can be found at the [Load sequence, performance and memory\\
topic](https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/performance).


## Flutter web support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#flutter-web-support)

While the general architectural concepts apply to all platforms that Flutter
supports, there are some unique characteristics of Flutter's web support that
are worthy of comment.


Dart has been compiling to JavaScript for as long as the language has existed,
with a toolchain optimized for both development and production purposes.
Many important apps compile from Dart to JavaScript and run in production today,
including the [advertiser tooling for Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/).
Because the Flutter framework is written in Dart, compiling it to JavaScript
was relatively straightforward.


However, the Flutter engine, written in C++,
is designed to interface with the
underlying operating system rather than a web browser.
A different approach is therefore required.


On the web, Flutter offers two renderers:

| Renderer | Compilation target |
| --- | --- |
| CanvasKit | JavaScript |
| Skwasm | WebAssembly |

_Build modes_ are command-line options that dictate
which renderers are available when you run the app.


Flutter offers two _build_ modes:

| Build mode | Available renderer(s) |
| --- | --- |
| default | CanvasKit |
| \`--wasm\` | Skwasm (preferred), CanvasKit (fallback) |

The default mode makes only CanvasKit renderer available.
The `--wasm` option makes both renderers available,
and chooses the engine based on browser capabilities:
preferring Skwasm if the browser is capable of running it,
and falls back to CanvasKit otherwise.


![Flutter web architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/arch-overview/web-framework-diagram.png)

Perhaps the most notable difference compared to other
platforms on which Flutter runs is that there is no need
for Flutter to provide a Dart runtime.
Instead, the Flutter framework (along with any code you write)
is compiled to JavaScript.
It's also worthy to note that Dart has very few language
semantic differences across all of its modes
(JIT versus AOT, native versus web compilation),
and most developers will never write a line of code that
runs into such a difference.


During development time, Flutter web uses
[`dartdevc`](https://dart.dev/tools/dartdevc),
a compiler that supports incremental compilation
and therefore allows hot restart and
\[hot reload behind a flag\]\[\].
Conversely, when you are ready to create a production app
for the web, [`dart2js`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart2js),
Dart's highly-optimized production JavaScript compiler is used,
packaging the Flutter core and framework along with your
application into a minified source file that
can be deployed to any web server.
Code can be offered in a single file or split
into multiple files through [deferred imports](https://dart.dev/language/libraries#lazily-loading-a-library).


For more information on Flutter web, check out
[Web support for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web) and [Web renderers](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/renderers).


## Further information

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#further-information)

For those interested in more information about the internals of Flutter,
the [Inside Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter) whitepaper
provides a useful guide to the framework's design philosophy.


1. While the `build` function returns a fresh tree,
    you only need to return something _different_ if
    there's some new configuration to incorporate.
    If the configuration is in fact the same,
    you can just return the same widget. [↩](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fnref-1)

2. This is a slight simplification for ease of reading.
    In practice, the tree might be more complex. [↩](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fnref-2)

3. There are some limitations with this approach, for example,
    transparency doesn't composite the same way for a platform view as
    it would for other Flutter widgets. [↩](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#fnref-3)

## Summary

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#summary)

The API for the [`Color`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Color-class.html)
class in `dart:ui` is changing to
support [wide gamut color spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_spaces).


## Context

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#context)

The Flutter engine [already supports wide gamut color](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/55092)
with [Impeller](https://api.flutter.dev/perf/impeller), and
the support is now being added [to the framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/127855).


The iOS devices that Flutter supports render to a larger array of colors,
specifically in the [DisplayP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3) color space.
After this change, the Flutter framework can
render all of those colors on iOS Impeller, and
the `Color` class is better prepared for future color spaces or
changes to color component bit depth.


## Description of change

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#description-of-change)

Changes to [`Color`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Color-class.html):


1. Adds an enum field that specifies its [`ColorSpace`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/ColorSpace.html).

2. Adds API to use normalized floating-point color components.
3. Removes API that uses 8-bit unsigned integer color components that can
    lead to data loss.


Changes to [`ColorSpace`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/ColorSpace.html):


1. Adds a `displayP3` property.

## Migration guide

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#migration-guide)

### 8-bit unsigned integer constructors

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#8-bit-unsigned-integer-constructors)

Constructors like `Color.fromARGB` remain unchanged and have continued support.
To take advantage of Display P3 colors, you must use the new
`Color.from` constructor that takes normalized floating-point color components.


dart

```
// Before: Constructing an sRGB color from the lower 8 bits of four integers.
final magenta = Color.fromARGB(0xff, 0xff, 0x0, 0xff);
​
// After: Constructing a color with normalized floating-point components.
final magenta = Color.from(alpha: 1.0, red: 1.0, green: 0.0, blue: 1.0);
```

content\_copy

### Implementors of `Color`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#implementors-of-color)

There are new methods being added to `Color` so
any class that `implements Color` will break and have to
implement the new methods, such as `Color.a` and `Color.b`.


Ultimately, implementors should migrate to take advantage of the new API.
In the short-term, these methods can easily be implemented without
changing the underlying structure of your class.


For example:

dart

```
class Foo implements Color {
  int _red;
​
  @override
  double get r => _red / 255.0;
}
```

content\_copy

### Color space support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#color-space-support)

Clients that use `Color` and perform any sort of calculation on
the color components should now first check the
color space component before performing calculations.
To help with that, you can use the new `Color.withValues` method to
perform color space conversions.


Example migration:

dart

```
// Before
double redRatio(Color x, Color y) => x.red / y.red;
​
// After
double redRatio(Color x, Color y) {
  final xPrime = x.withValues(colorSpace: ColorSpace.extendedSRGB);
  final yPrime = y.withValues(colorSpace: ColorSpace.extendedSRGB);
  return xPrime.r / yPrime.r;
}
```

content\_copy

Performing calculations with color components without
aligning color spaces can lead to subtle unexpected results.
In the preceding example, the `redRatio` would have the difference of `0.09`

when calculated with differing color spaces versus aligned color spaces.


### Access color components

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#access-color-components)

If your app ever accesses a `Color` component, consider
taking advantage of the floating-point components.
In the short term, you can scale the components themselves.


dart

```
extension IntColorComponents on Color {
  int get intAlpha => _floatToInt8(this.a);
  int get intRed => _floatToInt8(this.r);
  int get intGreen => _floatToInt8(this.g);
  int get intBlue => _floatToInt8(this.b);
​
  int _floatToInt8(double x) {
    return (x * 255.0).round() & 0xff;
  }
}
```

content\_copy

### Opacity

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#opacity)

Before Flutter 3.27, Color had the concept of "opacity" which showed up in the
methods `opacity` and `withOpacity()`. Opacity was introduced as a way to
communicate with `Color` about its alpha channel with floating-point values
(\[0.0, 1.0\]). Opacity methods were convenience methods for setting the 8-bit
alpha value (\[0, 255\]), but never offered the full expression of a
floating-point number. This was sufficient when color components were stored as
8-bit integers.


Since Flutter 3.27, alpha is stored as a floating-point value. Using `.a` and
`.withValues()` will give the full expression of a floating-point value and
won't be quantized (restricted to a limited range). That means "alpha" expresses
the intent of "opacity" more correctly. Opacity is different in a subtle way
where its usage can result in unexpected data loss, so `.withOpacity()`
and
`.opacity` have been deprecated and their semantics have been maintained to
avoid breaking anyone.


For example:

dart

```
// Prints 0.5019607843137255.
print(Colors.black.withOpacity(0.5).a);
// Prints 0.5.
print(Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.5).a);
```

content\_copy

Practically all usage will directly benefit from the more accurate colors. In
the rare case where it doesn't, care can be taken to quantize opacity to \[0,\
255\] using `.alpha` and `.withAlpha()` to match the behavior before Flutter
3.27.


#### Migrate `opacity`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#migrate-opacity)

dart

```
// Before: Access the alpha channel as a (converted) floating-point value.
final x = color.opacity;
​
// After: Access the alpha channel directly.
final x = color.a;
```

content\_copy

#### Migrate `withOpacity`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#migrate-withopacity)

dart

```
// Before: Create a new color with the specified opacity.
final x = color.withOpacity(0.0);
​
// After: Create a new color with the specified alpha channel value,
// accounting for the current or specified color space.
final x = color.withValues(alpha: 0.0);
```

content\_copy

### Equality

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/wide-gamut-framework#equality)

Once `Color` stores its color components as floating-point numbers,
equality works slightly differently.
When calculating colors, there might be a
tiny difference in values that could be considered equal.
To accommodate this use the [`closeTo`](https://api.flutter.dev/documentation/matcher/latest/matcher/closeTo.html)
or [`isColorSameAs`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/isSameColorAs.html)
matchers.


dart

```
// Before: Check exact equality of int-based color.
expect(calculateColor(), const Color(0xffff00ff));
​
// After: Check rough equality of floating-point-based color.
expect(calculateColor(), isSameColorAs(const Color(0xffff00ff)));
```

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Although Android and iOS offer high quality system fonts,
designers want support for custom fonts.
You might have a custom-built font from a designer,
or perhaps you downloaded a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


A typeface is the collection of glyphs or shapes that comprise
a given style of lettering.
A font is one representation of that typeface at a given weight or variation.
Roboto is a typeface and Roboto Bold is a font.


Flutter lets you apply a custom font across an entire app or to individual widgets.
This recipe creates an app that uses custom fonts with the following steps.


1. Choose your fonts.
2. Import the font files.
3. Declare the font in the pubspec.
4. Set a font as the default.
5. Use a font in a specific widget.

You don't need to follow each step as you go.
The guide offers completed example files at the end.


## Choose a font

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#choose-a-font)

Your choice of font should be more than a preference.
Consider which file formats work with Flutter and
how the font could affect design options and app performance.


#### Pick a supported font format

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#pick-a-supported-font-format)

Flutter supports the following font formats:

- OpenType font collections: `.ttc`
- TrueType fonts: `.ttf`
- OpenType fonts: `.otf`

Flutter does not support fonts in the Web Open Font Format,
`.woff` and `.woff2`, on desktop platforms.


#### Choose fonts for their specific benefits

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#choose-fonts-for-their-specific-benefits)

Few sources agree on what a font file type is or which uses less space.
The key difference between font file types involves how the format
encodes the glyphs in the file.
Most TrueType and OpenType font files have similar capabilities as they
borrowed from each other as the formats and fonts improved over time.


Which font you should use depends on the following considerations.

- How much variation you need for fonts in your app?
- How much file size you can accept fonts using in your app?
- How many languages you need to support in your app?

Research what options a given font offers,
like more than one weight or style per font file,
[variable font capability](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts),
the availability of multiple font files for a multiple font weights,
or more than one width per font.


Choose the typeface or font family that meets the design needs of your app.

## Import the font files

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#import-the-font-files)

To work with a font, import its font files into your Flutter project.

To import font files, perform the following steps.

1. If necessary, to match the remaining steps in this guide,
    change the name of your Flutter app to `custom_fonts`.





```
$ mv /path/to/my_app /path/to/custom_fonts
```

content\_copy

2. Navigate to the root of your Flutter project.





```
$ cd /path/to/custom_fonts
```

content\_copy

3. Create a `fonts` directory at the root of your Flutter project.





```
$ mkdir fonts
```

content\_copy

4. Move or copy the font files in a `fonts` or `assets`
    folder at the root of your Flutter project.





```
$ cp ~/Downloads/*.ttf ./fonts
```

content\_copy


The resulting folder structure should resemble the following:

```
custom_fonts/
|- fonts/
  |- Raleway-Regular.ttf
  |- Raleway-Italic.ttf
  |- RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
  |- RobotoMono-Bold.ttf
```

content\_copy

## Declare the font in the pubspec.yaml file

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#declare-the-font-in-the-pubspec-yaml-file)

After you've downloaded a font,
include a font definition in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
This font definition also specifies which font file should be used to
render a given weight or style in your app.


### Define fonts in the `pubspec.yaml` file

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#define-fonts-in-the-pubspec-yaml-file)

To add font files to your Flutter app, complete the following steps.

1. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file at the root of your Flutter project.





```
$ vi pubspec.yaml
```

content\_copy

2. Paste the following YAML block after the `flutter` declaration.



yaml

```
     fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: RobotoMono
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
```

content\_copy

This `pubspec.yaml` file defines the italic style for the
`Raleway` font family as the `Raleway-Italic.ttf` font file.
When you set `style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic)`,
Flutter swaps `Raleway-Regular` with `Raleway-Italic`.


The `family` value sets the name of the typeface.
You use this name in the [`fontFamily`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle/fontFamily.html)
property of a [`TextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
object.


The value of an `asset` is a relative path from the `pubspec.yaml` file
to the font file.
These files contain the outlines for the glyphs in the font.
When building the app,
Flutter includes these files in the app's asset bundle.


### Include font files for each font

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#include-font-files-for-each-font)

Different typefaces implement font files in different ways.
If you need a typeface with a variety of font weights and styles,
choose and import font files that represent that variety.


When you import a font file that doesn't include either multiple fonts
within it or variable font capabilities,
don't use the `style` or `weight` property to adjust how they display.
If you do use those properties on a regular font file,
Flutter attempts to _simulate_ the look.
The visual result will look quite different from using the correct font file.


### Set styles and weights with font files

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#set-styles-and-weights-with-font-files)

When you declare which font files represent styles or weights of a font,
you can apply the `style` or `weight` properties.


#### Set font weight

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#set-font-weight)

The `weight` property specifies the weight of the outlines in
the file as an integer multiple of 100, between 100 and 900.
These values correspond to the [`FontWeight`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FontWeight-class.html)
and can be used in the
[`fontWeight`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle/fontWeight.html)
property of a [`TextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
object.


In the `pubspec.yaml` shown in this guide,
you defined `RobotoMono-Bold` as the `700` weight of the font family.
To use the `RobotoMono-Bold` font that you added to your app,
set `fontWeight` to `FontWeight.w700` in your `TextStyle`
widget.


If you hadn't added `RobotoMono-Bold` to your app,
Flutter attempts to make the font look bold.
The text then might appear to be somewhat darker.


You can't use the `weight` property to override the weight of the font.
You can't set `RobotoMono-Bold` to any other weight than `700`.
If you set `TextStyle(fontFamily: 'RobotoMono', fontWeight: FontWeight.w900)`,
the displayed font would still render as however bold `RobotoMono-Bold`
looks.


#### Set font style

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#set-font-style)

The `style` property specifies whether the glyphs in the font file display as
either `italic` or `normal`.
These values correspond to the [`FontStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/FontStyle.html).
You can use these styles in the [`fontStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle/fontStyle.html)
property
of a [`TextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
object.


In the `pubspec.yaml` shown in this guide,
you defined `Raleway-Italic` as being in the `italic` style.
To use the `Raleway-Italic` font that you added to your app,
set `style: TextStyle(fontStyle: FontStyle.italic)`.
Flutter swaps `Raleway-Regular` with `Raleway-Italic` when rendering.


If hadn't added `Raleway-Italic` to your app,
Flutter attempts to make the font _look_ italic.
The text then might appear to be leaning to the right.


You can't use the `style` property to override the glyphs of a font.
If you set `TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Raleway', fontStyle: FontStyle.normal)`,
the displayed font would still render as italic.
The `regular` style of an italic font _is_ italic.


## Set a font as the default

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#set-a-font-as-the-default)

To apply a font to text, you can set the font as the app's default font
in its `theme`.


To set a default font, set the `fontFamily` property in the app's `theme`.
Match the `fontFamily` value to the `family` name declared in the
`pubspec.yaml` file.


The result would resemble the following code.

dart

```
return MaterialApp(
title: 'Custom Fonts',
// Set Raleway as the default app font.
theme: ThemeData(fontFamily: 'Raleway'),
home: const MyHomePage(),
);
```

content\_copy

To learn more about themes,
check out the [Using Themes to share colors and font styles](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes)
recipe.


## Set the font in a specific widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts#set-the-font-in-a-specific-widget)

To apply the font to a specific widget like a `Text` widget,
provide a [`TextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
to the widget.


For this guide,
try to apply the `RobotoMono` font to a single `Text` widget.
Match the `fontFamily` value to the `family` name declared in the
`pubspec.yaml` file.


The result would resemble the following code.

dart

```
child: Text(
'Roboto Mono sample',
style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'RobotoMono'),
),
```

content\_copy

​
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return MaterialApp(
         title: 'Custom Fonts',
         // Set Raleway as the default app font.
         theme: ThemeData(fontFamily: 'Raleway'),
         home: const MyHomePage(),
       );
     }
}
​
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
     const MyHomePage({super.key});
​
     @override
     Widget build(BuildContext context) {
       return Scaffold(
         // The AppBar uses the app-default Raleway font.
         appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Custom Fonts')),
         body: const Center(
           // This Text widget uses the RobotoMono font.
           child: Text(
             'Roboto Mono sample',
             style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'RobotoMono'),
           ),
         ),
       );
     }
}
```

![List of supported platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/platforms.png)

One of Flutter's primary goals is to create a framework
that allows you to develop apps from a single codebase
that look and feel great on any platform.


This means that your app might appear on screens of
many different sizes, from a watch, to a foldable
phone with two screens, to a high definition monitor.
And your input device might be a physical or
virtual keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, or
any number of other devices.


Two terms that describe these design concepts
are _adaptive_ and _responsive_. Ideally,
you'd want your app to be _both_ but what,
exactly, does this mean?


## What is responsive vs adaptive?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive#what-is-responsive-vs-adaptive)

An easy way to think about it is that responsive design
is about fitting the UI _into_ the space and
adaptive design is about the UI being _usable_ in
the space.


So, a responsive app adjusts the placement of design
elements to _fit_ the available space. And an
adaptive app selects the appropriate layout and
input devices to be usable _in_ the available space.
For example, should a tablet UI use bottom navigation or
side-panel navigation?


This section covers various aspects of adaptive and
responsive design:


- [General approach](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general)
- [SafeArea & MediaQuery](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery)
- [Large screens & foldables](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens)
- [User input & accessibility](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/input)

[vertical\_align\_topWeb accessibility](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

## Background

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#background)

Flutter supports web accessibility by translating its internal
Semantics tree into an accessible HTML DOM structure that
screen readers can understand.
Since Flutter renders its UI on a single canvas, it needs a special layer
to expose the UI's meaning and structure to web browsers.


## Opt-in web accessibility

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#opt-in-web-accessibility)

### Invisible button

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#invisible-button)

For performance reasons, Flutter's web accessibility is not on by default.
To turn on accessibility, the user needs to press an invisible button with
`aria-label="Enable accessibility"`.
After pressing the button, the DOM tree will reflect all accessibility
information for the widgets.


### Turn on accessibility mode in code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#turn-on-accessibility-mode-in-code)

An alternative approach is to turn on accessibility mode
by adding the following code when running an app.


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/semantics.dart';
​
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
  if (kIsWeb) {
    SemanticsBinding.instance.ensureSemantics();
  }
}
```

## Enhancing Accessibility with Semantic Roles

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#enhancing-accessibility-with-semantic-roles)

### What are Semantic Roles?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#what-are-semantic-roles)

Semantic roles define the purpose of a UI element, helping screen readers
and other assistive tools interpret and present your application effectively
to users. For example, a role can indicate if a widget is a button, a link,
to users. For example, a role can indicate whether a widget is a button, a link,
a heading, a slider, or part of a table.


While Flutter's standard widgets often provide these semantics automatically,
a custom component without a clearly defined role can be incomprehensible
to a screen reader user.


By assigning appropriate roles, you ensure that:

- Screen readers can announce the type and purpose of elements correctly.
- Users can navigate your application more effectively using assistive technologies.
- Your application adheres to web accessibility standards, improving usability.

### Using `SemanticsRole` in Flutter for web

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility/web-accessibility#using-semanticsrole-in-flutter-for-web)

Flutter provides the [`Semantics` widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html)
with the [`SemanticsRole` enum](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/SemanticsRole.html)

to allow developers to assign specific roles to their widgets. When your
Flutter web app is rendered, these Flutter-specific roles are translated into
corresponding ARIA roles in the web page's HTML structure.


**1\. Automatic Semantics from Standard Widgets**

Many standard Flutter widgets, like `TabBar`, `MenuAnchor`, and `Table`,
automatically include semantic information along with their roles.
Whenever possible, prefer using these standard widgets
as they handle many accessibility aspects out-of-the-box.


**2\. Explicitly adding or overriding roles**

For custom components or when the default semantics aren't sufficient,
use the `Semantics` widget to define the role:


Here's an example of how you might explicitly define a list and its items:

dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/semantics.dart';
​
​
class MyCustomListWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyCustomListWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // This example shows how to explicitly assign list and listitem roles
    // when building a custom list structure.
    return Semantics(
      role: SemanticsRole.list,
      explicitChildNodes: true,
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[\
          Semantics(\
            role: SemanticsRole.listItem,\
            child: const Padding(\
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),\
              child: Text('Content of the first custom list item.'),\
            ),\
          ),\
          Semantics(\
            role: SemanticsRole.listItem,\
            child: const Padding(\
              padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),\
              child: Text('Content of the second custom list item.'),\
            ),\
          ),\
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This page provides an overview of how to configure, run, and build a web
application using Flutter.


## Requirements

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#requirements)

Before you can build a web application with Flutter,
make sure that you have the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started) and a web browser installed.
See the [Set up web development for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/setup)
instructions
for details.


## Set up a Flutter project

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#set-up-a-flutter-project)

To set up your project, you can create a
new Flutter project or add web support
to an existing project.


### Create a new project

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#create-a-new-project)

To create a new app that includes web support, run the following command:

```
$ flutter create my_app
```

content\_copy

### Add web support to an existing project

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#add-web-support-to-an-existing-project)

If you already have a project,
run the `flutter create` command in your project directory:


```
$ flutter create . --platforms web
```

content\_copy

This creates a `web/` directory containing the web assets used to bootstrap
and run your Flutter app.


## Run your app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#run-your-app)

See the following sections to run your app.

### Run your app from the command line

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#run-your-app-from-the-command-line)

Select [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as your app's target device to run and debug
a Flutter web app:


```
$ flutter run -d chrome
```

content\_copy

You can also choose Chrome as a target device in your IDE.

If you prefer, you can use the `edge` device type on Windows,
or use `web-server` to
navigate to a local URL in the browser of your choice.


### Run your app using WebAssembly

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#run-your-app-using-webassembly)

You can pass the `--wasm` flag to run your app using WebAssembly:

```
$ flutter run -d chrome --wasm
```

content\_copy

Flutter web offers multiple build modes and renderers.
For more information, see [Web renderers](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/renderers).


### Disable hot reload in VS Code

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#disable-hot-reload-in-vs-code)

To temporarily disable hot reload support from VS Code,
update your [`launch.json` file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging-configuration)
file with
the flag `--no-web-experimental-hot-reload`.


```
"configurations": [\
    ...\
    {\
      "name": "Flutter for web (hot reload disabled)",\
      "type": "dart",\
      "request": "launch",\
      "program": "lib/main.dart",\
      "args": [\
        "-d",\
        "chrome",\
        "--no-web-experimental-hot-reload",\

### Use hot reload in DartPad

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#use-hot-reload-in-dartpad)

Hot reload is also enabled in DartPad with a new "Reload" button.
The feature is only available if Flutter is detected
in the running application. You can begin a hot reloadable
session by selecting a sample app provided by DartPad.


## Build your app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#build-your-app)

See the following sections to build your app.

### Build your app from the command line

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#build-your-app-from-the-command-line)

Run the following command to generate a release build:

```
$ flutter build web
```

content\_copy

### Build your app using WebAssembly

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#build-your-app-using-webassembly)

You can also pass the `--wasm` flag to build your app using WebAssembly:

```
$ flutter build web --wasm
```

content\_copy

This populates a `build/web` directory
with built files, including an `assets` directory,
which need to be served together.


To learn more about how to deploy these assets to the web, see
[Build and release a web app](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web).

As of Flutter 3.38.6,
Flutter supports deploying apps on the following combinations of
hardware architectures and operating system versions.
These combinations are called _platforms_.


Flutter categorizes platforms as follows:

- **Supported**: The platforms and versions that the Flutter team supports.
- **CI-tested**: The Flutter team tests these platforms on every commit.
- **Unsupported**: The Flutter team doesn't test or support these platforms.

Based on these categories,
Flutter supports deploying to the following platforms.

[vertical\_align\_topSafeArea & MediaQuery](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This page discusses how and when to use the
`SafeArea` and `MediaQuery` widgets.


## SafeArea

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery#safearea)

When running your app on the latest devices,
you might encounter bits of the UI being blocked
by cutouts on the device's screen.
You can fix this with the [`SafeArea`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SafeArea-class.html)
widget,
which insets its child widget to avoid intrusions
(like notches and camera cutouts),
as well as operating system UI
(such as the status bar on Android),
or by rounded corners of the physical display.


If you don't want this behavior,
the `SafeArea` widget allows you to
disable padding on any of its four sides.
By default, all four sides are enabled.


It's generally recommended to wrap the body of a
`Scaffold` widget in `SafeArea` as a good place to start,
but you don't always need to put it this high in the
`Widget` tree.


For example, if you purposefully want your app to stretch
under the cutouts, you can move the `SafeArea` to wrap
whatever content makes sense,
and let the rest of the app take up the full screen.


Using `SafeArea` ensures that your app content won't be
cut off by physical display features or operating system UI,
and sets your app up for success even as new devices with
different shapes and styles of cutouts enter the market.


How does `SafeArea` do so much in a small amount of code?
Behind the scenes it uses the `MediaQuery` object.


## MediaQuery

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery#mediaquery)

As discussed in the [SafeArea](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery#safearea) section,
`MediaQuery` is a powerful widget for creating
adaptive apps. Sometimes you'll use `MediaQuery`
directly, and sometimes you'll use `SafeArea`,
which uses `MediaQuery` behind the scenes.


`MediaQuery` provides lots of information,
including the app's current window size.
It exposes accessibility settings like high contrast mode
and text scaling, or if the user is using an accessibility
service like TalkBack or VoiceOver.
`MediaQuery` also contains info about the features
of your device's display, such as having a hinge or a fold.


`SafeArea` uses the data from `MediaQuery` to figure out
how much to inset its child `Widget`.
Specifically, it uses the `MediaQuery` padding property,
which is basically the amount of the display that's
partially obscured by system UI, display notches, or status bar.


So, why not use `MediaQuery` directly?

The answer is that `SafeArea` does one clever thing
that makes it beneficial to use over just raw `MediaQueryData`.
Specifically, it modifies the `MediaQuery` exposed
to `SafeArea`'s children to make it appear as if the
padding added to `SafeArea` doesn't exist.
This means that you can nest `SafeArea`s,
and only the topmost one will apply the padding
needed to avoid the notches as system UI.


As your app grows and you move widgets around,
you don't have to worry about having too much
padding applied if you have multiple `SafeArea`s,
whereas you would have issues if using
`MediaQueryData.padding` directly.


You _can_ wrap the body of a `Scaffold` widget
with a `SafeArea`, but you don't _have_ to put it this high
in the widget tree.
The `SafeArea` just needs to wrap the contents
that would cause information loss if cut off by the
hardware features mentioned earlier.


For example, if you purposefully want your app to stretch
under the cutouts, you can move the `SafeArea` to wrap
whatever content makes sense,
and let the rest of the app take up the full screen.
A side note is that this is what the `AppBar` widget
does by default, which is how it goes underneath the
system status bar. This is also why wrapping the body
of a `Scaffold` in a `SafeArea` is recommended,
instead of wrapping the whole `Scaffold` itself.


`SafeArea` ensures that your app content won't be
cut off in a generic way and sets your app up
for success even as new devices with different
shapes and styles of cutouts enter the market.

## Questions

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#questions)

### What scenarios are ideal for Flutter on the web?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#what-scenarios-are-ideal-for-flutter-on-the-web)

Not every web page makes sense in Flutter, but we think Flutter is particularly
suited for app-centric experiences:


- Progressive Web Apps
- Single Page Apps
- Existing Flutter mobile apps

At this time, Flutter is not suitable for static websites with text-rich
flow-based content. For example, blog articles benefit from the document-centric
model that the web is built around, rather than the app-centric services that a
UI framework like Flutter can deliver. However, you _can_ use Flutter to embed
interactive experiences into these websites.


For more information on how you can use Flutter on the web,
see [Web support for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web).


### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#search-engine-optimization-seo)

In general, Flutter is geared towards dynamic application experiences. Flutter's
web support is no exception. Flutter web prioritizes performance, fidelity, and
consistency. This means application output does not align with what search
engines need to properly index. For web content that is static or document-like,
we recommend using HTML—just like we do on [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/),
[dart.dev](https://dart.dev/), and [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). You should also
consider separating your primary application experience—created in Flutter—from
your landing page, marketing content, and help content—created using
search-engine optimized HTML.


That said, as mentioned in the [roadmap](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/roadmap/Roadmap.md#web-platform), the Flutter team plans to
investigate search engine indexability of Flutter web.


### Does hot reload work with a web app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#does-hot-reload-work-with-a-web-app)

Yes! For more information, check out
[hot reload on the web](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building#hot-reload-web).


Hot restart is a fast way of seeing your
changes without having to relaunch your web app and wait for it
to compile and load. This works similarly to
the hot reload feature for Flutter mobile development.
The difference is that hot reload remembers your state and hot
restart doesn't.


### Which web browsers are supported by Flutter?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#which-web-browsers-are-supported-by-flutter)

Flutter web apps can run on the following browsers:

- Chrome (mobile & desktop)
- Safari (mobile & desktop)
- Edge (mobile & desktop)
- Firefox (mobile & desktop)

During development, Chrome (on macOS, Windows, and Linux) and Edge (on Windows)
are supported as the default browsers for debugging your app.


### Can I build, run, and deploy web apps in any of the IDEs?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#can-i-build-run-and-deploy-web-apps-in-any-of-the-ides)

You can select **Chrome** or **Edge** as the target device in
Android Studio/IntelliJ and VS Code.


The device pulldown should now include the **Chrome (web)**
option for all channels.


### How do I build a responsive app for the web?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#how-do-i-build-a-responsive-app-for-the-web)

See [Creating responsive apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive).

### Can I use `dart:io` with a web app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#can-i-use-dart-io-with-a-web-app)

No. The file system is not accessible from the browser.
For network functionality, use the [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http)

package. Note that security works somewhat
differently because the browser (and not the app)
controls the headers on an HTTP request.


### How do I handle web-specific imports?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#how-do-i-handle-web-specific-imports)

Some plugins require platform-specific imports, particularly if they use the
file system, which is not accessible from the browser. To use these plugins
in your app, see the [documentation for conditional imports](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/create-library-packages#conditionally-importing-and-exporting-library-files)

on [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/).


### Does Flutter web support concurrency?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#does-flutter-web-support-concurrency)

Dart's concurrency support via [isolates](https://dart.dev/guides/language/concurrency)
is not currently supported in Flutter web.


Flutter web apps can potentially work around this
by using [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers),
although no such support is built in.


### How do I deploy a web app?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#how-do-i-deploy-a-web-app)

See [Preparing a web app for release](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web).

### Does `Platform.is` work on the web?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#does-platform-is-work-on-the-web)

Not currently.

### Why doesn't my app update immediately after it's deployed?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#why-doesnt-my-app-update-immediately-after-its-deployed)

You might need to configure the `Cache-Control` header returned by your web server.
For example, if this header is set to 3600, then the browser
and CDN will cache the asset for 1 hour, and your users might see an out-of-date
version of your app up to 1 hour after you deploy a new version. For
more information about caching on the web,
check out [Prevent unnecessary network requests with the HTTP Cache](https://web.dev/articles/http-cache).


It is a good idea to be aware of this behavior to avoid an undesirable user experience.
After you deploy your app, users might use a
cached version of your app (cached by the browser or CDN)
for the duration defined by your cache headers.
This can lead to users using a version of your app that
is incompatible with changes that have been deployed to backend services.


### How do I clear the web cache after a deployment and force an app download?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#how-do-i-clear-the-web-cache-after-a-deployment-and-force-an-app-download)

If you wish to defeat these cache headers after each deployment, a common
technique is to append a build ID of some sort to the links of your static
resources, or update the filenames themselves.
For example, `logo.png` might become `logo.v123.png`.


html

```
<!-- Option 1, append build ID as a query parameter in your links -->
<script src="flutter_bootstrap.js?v=123" async></script>
​
<!-- Option 2, update the filename and update your links -->
<script src="flutter_bootstrap.v123.js" async></script>
```

content\_copy

Flutter does not currently support appending build IDs to resources
automatically.


### How do I configure my cache headers?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#how-do-i-configure-my-cache-headers)

If you are using Firebase Hosting,
the shared cache (CDN) is invalidated when you deploy a new version of your
app. But you might choose to configure your cache headers as follows,
so that the browser cache doesn't cache application scripts,
but the shared cache does.


json

```
{
  "hosting": {
    "headers": [\
      {\
        "source":\
          "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg|webp|css|eot|otf|ttf|ttc|woff|woff2|font.css)",\
        "headers": [\
          {\
            "key": "Cache-Control",\
            "value": "max-age=3600,s-maxage=604800"\
          }\
        ]\
      },\
      {\
        "source":\
          "**/*.@(mjs|js|wasm|json)",\
        "headers": [\
          {\
            "key": "Cache-Control",\
            "value": "max-age=0,s-maxage=604800"\
          }\
        ]\
      }\
    ]
  }
}
```

### How do I configure a service worker?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/faq#how-do-i-configure-a-service-worker)

The service worker generated by `flutter build web` is deprecated,
and you can disable it by setting the `--pwa-strategy` flag to `none`

when running the `flutter build web` command.


```
flutter build web --pwa-strategy=none
```

content\_copy

If you would like to continue to use a service worker, you can
[build your own](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers)
or try third-party tools
such as [Workbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox).


If your service worker is not refreshing,
configure your CDN and browser cache by setting
the `Cache-Control` header to a small value such as 0 or 60 seconds.

## Introduction

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#introduction)

This guide describes how to run integration tests with your Flutter app. With
it, you'll learn how to do the following:


- Set up integration tests.
- Verify if an app displays specific text.
- Tap specific widgets.
- Run integration tests.

The guide references the `counter_app` project that comes with
Flutter and the Flutter [`integration_test`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/packages/integration_test#integration_test)
package. The
`integration_test` package lets you:


- Use the `flutter drive` command to run tests on a physical device or emulator.
- Run on [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab), to automate testing on a variety of devices.

- Use [flutter\_test](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html)
APIs to write tests in a style similar to
[widget tests](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/overview#widget-tests).


## Create a new app to test

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#create-a-new-app-to-test)

Integration testing requires an app to test.
This example uses the built-in **Counter App** example
that Flutter produces when you run the `flutter create` command.
The counter app allows a user to tap on a button to increase a counter.


1. To create an instance of the built-in Flutter app,
    run the following command in your terminal:





```
$ flutter create counter_app
```

content\_copy

2. Change into the `counter_app` directory.

3. Open `lib/main.dart` in your preferred IDE.

4. Add a `key` parameter to the `floatingActionButton()` widget
    with an instance of a `Key` class with a string value of `increment`.



dart

```
    floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
      key: const ValueKey('increment'),
      onPressed: _incrementCounter,
      tooltip: 'Increment',
      child: const Icon(Icons.add),
    ),
```

content\_copy

5. Save your `lib/main.dart` file.


After these changes,
the `lib/main.dart` file should resemble the following code.


lib/main.dart

dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());
​
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      title: 'Counter App',
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Counter App Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
​
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});
​
  final String title;
​
  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}
​
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;
​
  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(widget.title)),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[\
            const Text('You have pushed the button this many times:'),\
            Text(\
              '$_counter',\
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,\
            ),\
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        // Provide a Key to this button. This allows finding this
        // specific button inside the test suite, and tapping it.
        key: const Key('increment'),
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

## Add the `integration_test` dependency

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#add-the-integration-test-dependency)

You need to add the testing packages to your new app.

To add `integration_test` and `flutter_test` packages as
`dev_dependencies` using `sdk: flutter`, run following command.


```
$ flutter pub add 'dev:integration_test:{"sdk":"flutter"}'
```

content\_copy

Output:

```

  # ... added dependencies

  flutter_lints: ^6.0.0
  integration_test:

# ...
```

content\_copy

## Create the integration test files

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#create-the-integration-test-files)

Integration tests reside in a separate directory inside
your Flutter project.


1. Create a new directory named `integration_test`.
2. Add empty file named `app_test.dart` in that directory.

The resulting directory tree should resemble the following:

```
counter_app/
  lib/
    main.dart
  integration_test/
    app_test.dart
```

content\_copy

## Write the integration test

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#write-the-integration-test)

The integration test file consists of a Dart code file
with dependencies on `integration_test`, `flutter_test`,
and your app's Dart file.


1. Open your `integration_test/app_test.dart` file in your preferred IDE.

2. Copy the following code and paste it into your
    `integration_test/app_test.dart` file.
    The last import should point to the `main.dart` file
    of your `counter_app`.
    (This `import` points to the example app called `introduction`.)



integration\_test/counter\_test.dart



dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:how_to/main.dart';
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';
​
void main() {
     IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
​
     group('end-to-end test', () {
       testWidgets('tap on the floating action button, verify counter', (
         tester,
       ) async {
         // Load app widget.
         await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());
​
         // Verify the counter starts at 0.
         expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);
​
         // Finds the floating action button to tap on.
         final fab = find.byKey(const ValueKey('increment'));
​
         // Emulate a tap on the floating action button.
         await tester.tap(fab);
​
         // Trigger a frame.
         await tester.pumpAndSettle();
​
         // Verify the counter increments by 1.
         expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);
       });
     });
}
```

content\_copy


This example goes through three steps:

1. Initialize `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`.
    This singleton service executes tests on a physical device.

2. Interact and test widgets using the `WidgetTester` class.

3. Test the important scenarios.


## Run integration tests

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#run-integration-tests)

The integration tests that run vary depending on the
platform on which you test.


- To test a desktop platform, use the command line or a CI system.
- To test a mobile platform, use the command line or Firebase Test Lab.
- To test in a web browser, use the command line.

* * *

### Test on a desktop platform

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#test-on-a-desktop-platform)

Expand if you test Linux apps using a CI system

To test a Linux app, your CI system must invoke an X server first.
In the GitHub Action, GitLab Runner, or similar configuration file,
set the integration test to work _with_ the `xvfb-run` tool.

Doing this invokes an X Window system into which Flutter can
launch and test your Linux app.

As an example using GitHub Actions, your `jobs.setup.steps` should
include a step resembling the following:

yaml

```
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        uses: username/xvfb-action@v1.1.2
        with:
          run: flutter test integration_test -d linux -r github
```

content\_copy

This starts the integration test within an X Window.

If you don't configure your integration in this way,
Flutter returns an error.

```
Building Linux application...
Error waiting for a debug connection: The log reader stopped unexpectedly, or never started.
```

content\_copy

To test on a macOS, Windows, or Linux platform,
complete the following tasks.


1. Run the following command from the root of the project.





```
$ flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
```

content\_copy

2. If offered a choice of platform to test,
    choose the desktop platform.
    Type `1` to choose the desktop platform.


Based on platform, the command result should resemble the following output.

- [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#135-tab-panel)
- [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#136-tab-panel)
- [Linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests#137-tab-panel)

## What is Impeller?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#what-is-impeller)

Impeller provides a new rendering runtime for Flutter.
Impeller precompiles a [smaller, simpler set of shaders](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/77412)

at engine-build time so they don't compile at runtime.


For a video introduction to Impeller, check out the following
talk from Google I/O 2023.


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Introducing Impeller, Flutter's new rendering engine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/vd5NqS01rlA)

Impeller has the following objectives:

- **Predictable performance**:
Impeller compiles all shaders and reflection offline at build time.
It builds all pipeline state objects upfront.
The engine controls caching and caches explicitly.

- **Instrumentable**:
Impeller tags and labels all graphics resources,
such as textures and buffers.
It can capture and persist animations to disk without affecting
per-frame rendering performance.

- **Portable**:
Flutter doesn't tie Impeller to a specific client-rendering API.
You can author shaders once and convert them to backend-specific
formats, as necessary.

- **Leverages modern graphics APIs**:
Impeller uses, but doesn't depend on, features available in
modern APIs like Metal and Vulkan.

- **Leverages concurrency**:
Impeller can distribute single-frame workloads across multiple
threads, if necessary.


## Availability

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#availability)

Where can you use Impeller? For _detailed_ info, check out
the [Can I use Impeller?](https://flutter.dev/go/can-i-use-impeller) page.


### iOS

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#ios)

Since [Flutter 3.29](https://blog.flutter.dev/whats-new-in-flutter-3-29-f90c380c2317), Impeller is the
**default on iOS** with no ability to
switch to Skia.


### Android

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#android)

Impeller is **available and enabled by default on Android API 29+**.
On devices running lower versions of Android or don't support Vulkan,
Impeller falls back to the the legacy OpenGL renderer.
No action on your part is necessary for this fallback behavior.


- To _disable_ Impeller when debugging,
pass `--no-enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.





```
flutter run --no-enable-impeller
```

content\_copy

- To _disable_ Impeller when deploying your app,
add the following setting to your project's
`AndroidManifest.xml` file under the `<application>`
tag:


xml

```
<meta-data
    android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller"
    android:value="false" />
```

content\_copy

### Web

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#web)

Flutter on the web offers [two renderers](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/renderers#renderers) --
`canvaskit` and `skwasm` \-\- which both currently use Skia.
They might use Impeller in the future.


### macOS

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller#macos)

You can try out Impeller for macOS behind a flag.
In a future release, the ability to opt-out of
using Impeller will be removed.


To enable Impeller on macOS when debugging,
pass `--enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.


```
flutter run --enable-impeller
```

content\_copy

To enable Impeller on macOS when deploying your app,
add the following tags under the top-level
`<dict>` tag in your app's `Info.plist` file.


xml

```
  <key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
  <true />
```

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This guide covers how you can leverage AI rules to
streamline your Flutter and Dart development.


## Overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/ai-rules#overview)

AI-powered editors use rules files to provide context and
instructions to an underlying LLM. These files help you:


- Customize AI behavior to your team's needs.
- Enforce project best practices for code style and
design.

- Provide critical project context to the AI.

The Flutter project provides several versions of the rules file to accommodate
different tool limits:


- [`rules.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/flutter/refs/heads/main/docs/rules/rules.md):
The comprehensive master rule set.

- [`rules_10k.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/flutter/refs/heads/main/docs/rules/rules_10k.md):
A condensed version (<10k chars) for tools with stricter context limits.

- [`rules_4k.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/flutter/refs/heads/main/docs/rules/rules_4k.md):
A highly concise version (<4k chars) for limited contexts.

- [`rules_1k.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/flutter/refs/heads/main/docs/rules/rules_1k.md):
An ultra-compact version (<1k chars) for very strict limits.

## Create rules for your editor

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/ai-rules#create-rules-for-your-editor)

You can adapt our Flutter and Dart rules template for your
specific environment. To do so, follow these steps:


1. Download the Flutter and Dart rules template:
    [`rules.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/flutter/refs/heads/main/docs/rules/rules.md)

2. In an LLM like [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), attach the
    `rules.md` file that you downloaded in
    the last step.

3. Provide a prompt to reformat the file for your desired
    editor.

Example prompt:





```
Convert the attached rules.md file
into a guidelines.md file for Gemini CLI. Make sure
to use the styles required for a guidelines.md file.
```

content\_copy

4. Review the LLM's output and make any necessary
    adjustments.

5. Follow your environment's instructions to add the new
    rules file. This may involve adding to an existing file
    or creating a new one.

6. Verify that your AI assistant is using the new rules to
    guide its responses.

Material Design is an open-source design system built
and supported by Google designers and developers.


The latest version, Material 3, enables personal,
adaptive, and expressive experiences—from dynamic color
and enhanced accessibility, to foundations for
large screen layouts, and design tokens.


For _most_ Flutter widgets, upgrading to Material 3
is seamless. But _some_ widgets couldn't be
updated—entirely new implementations were needed,
such as [`NavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationBar-class.html).
You must make these changes to your code manually.
Until your app is entirely updated,
the UI might look or act a bit strange.
You can find the entirely new Material components by
visiting the [Affected widgets](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData/useMaterial3.html#affected-widgets)
page.


Explore the updated components, typography, color system,
and elevation support with the
[Material 3 demo](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/main/material_3_demo/).

[vertical\_align\_topBuild a form with validation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/forms/validation#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Apps often require users to enter information into a text field.
For example, you might require users to log in with an email address
and password combination.


To make apps secure and easy to use, check whether the
information the user has provided is valid. If the user has correctly filled
out the form, process the information. If the user submits incorrect
information, display a friendly error message letting them know what went
wrong.


In this example, learn how to add validation to a form that has
a single text field using the following steps:


1. Create a `Form` with a `GlobalKey`.
2. Add a `TextFormField` with validation logic.
3. Create a button to validate and submit the form.

## 1\. Create a `Form` with a `GlobalKey`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/forms/validation#1-create-a-form-with-a-globalkey)

Create a [`Form`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Form-class.html).
The `Form` widget acts as a container for grouping and
validating multiple form fields.


When creating the form, provide a [`GlobalKey`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GlobalKey-class.html).
This assigns a unique identifier to your `Form`.
It also allows you to validate the form later.


Create the form as a `StatefulWidget`.
This allows you to create a unique `GlobalKey<FormState>()` once.
You can then store it as a variable and access it at different points.


If you made this a `StatelessWidget`, you'd need to store this key _somewhere_.
As it is resource expensive, you wouldn't want to generate a new
`GlobalKey` each time you run the `build` method.


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
// Define a custom Form widget.
class MyCustomForm extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyCustomForm({super.key});
​
  @override
  MyCustomFormState createState() {
    return MyCustomFormState();
  }
}
​
// Define a corresponding State class.
// This class holds data related to the form.
class MyCustomFormState extends State<MyCustomForm> {
  // Create a global key that uniquely identifies the Form widget
  // and allows validation of the form.
  //
  // Note: This is a `GlobalKey<FormState>`,
  // not a GlobalKey<MyCustomFormState>.
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build a Form widget using the _formKey created above.
    return Form(
      key: _formKey,
      child: const Column(
        children: <Widget>[\
          // Add TextFormFields and ElevatedButton here.\
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 2\. Add a `TextFormField` with validation logic

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/forms/validation#2-add-a-textformfield-with-validation-logic)

Although the `Form` is in place,
it doesn't have a way for users to enter text.
That's the job of a [`TextFormField`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html).
The `TextFormField` widget renders a material design text field
and can display validation errors when they occur.


Validate the input by providing a `validator()` function to the
`TextFormField`. If the user's input isn't valid,
the `validator` function returns a `String` containing
an error message.
If there are no errors, the validator must return null.


For this example, create a `validator` that ensures the
`TextFormField` isn't empty. If it is empty,
return a friendly error message.


dart

```
TextFormField(
  // The validator receives the text that the user has entered.
  validator: (value) {
    if (value == null || value.isEmpty) {
      return 'Please enter some text';
    }
    return null;
  },
),
```

content\_copy

## 3\. Create a button to validate and submit the form

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/forms/validation#3-create-a-button-to-validate-and-submit-the-form)

Now that you have a form with a text field,
provide a button that the user can tap to submit the information.


When the user attempts to submit the form, check if the form is valid.
If it is, display a success message.
If it isn't (the text field has no content) display the error message.


dart

```
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Validate returns true if the form is valid, or false otherwise.
    if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
      // If the form is valid, display a snackbar. In the real world,
      // you'd often call a server or save the information in a database.
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        const SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')),
      );
    }
  },
  child: const Text('Submit'),
),
```

content\_copy

### How does this work?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/forms/validation#how-does-this-work)

To validate the form, use the `_formKey` created in
step 1. You can use the `_formKey.currentState`
accessor to access the [`FormState`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FormState-class.html),
which is automatically created by Flutter when building a `Form`.


The `FormState` class contains the `validate()` method.
When the `validate()` method is called, it runs the `validator()`

function for each text field in the form.
If everything looks good, the `validate()` method returns `true`.
If any text field contains errors, the `validate()` method
rebuilds the form to display any error messages and returns `false`.


## Interactive example

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/forms/validation#interactive-example)

[Retrieve the value of a text field](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/forms/retrieve-input) recipe.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This is Dash:

![Dash by herself](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/Dash.png)

Dash is the mascot for the Dart language and the Flutter framework.

![A sample of Dashatars](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/Dashatars.png)

![GIF of Dash fainting created for Flutter Engage](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/dash-fainting.webp)

## How did it all start?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/dash#how-did-it-all-start)

As soon as Shams Zakhour started working as a
Dart writer at Google in December 2013,
she started advocating for a Dart mascot.
After documenting Java for 14 years, she
had observed how beloved the Java mascot,
[Duke](https://www.oracle.com/java/duke.html), had become,
and she wanted something similar for Dart.


But the idea didn't gain momentum until 2017,
when one of the Flutter engineers, Nina Chen,
suggested it on an internal mailing list.
The Flutter VP at the time, Joshy Joseph,
approved the idea and asked the
organizer for the [2018 Dart Conference](https://events.dartlang.org/2018/dartconf/),
Linda Rasmussen, to make it happen.


Once Shams heard about these plans,
she rushed to Linda and asked to own and drive
the project to produce the plushies for the conference.
Linda had already elicited some design sketches,
which she handed off.
Starting with the sketches, Shams located a vendor
who could work within an aggressive deadline
(competing with Lunar New Year),
and started the process of creating
the specs for the plushy.


That's right, Dash was originally a
**Dart** mascot, not a Flutter mascot.


Here are some early mockups and one of the first prototypes:

![1st mockup made by Novicell.dk](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/early-dash-sketches.png)![2nd mockup by Squishable.com](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/early-dash-sketches2.jpg)

![Prototype 1](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/early-dash-sketches3.jpg)![Playing with embroidery ideas](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/early-dash-sketches4.jpg)

![First prototype](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/early-dash-sketches5.jpg)

The first prototype had uneven eyes


## Why a hummingbird?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/dash#why-a-hummingbird)

Early on, a hummingbird image was created for the Dart team
to use for presentations and the web.
The hummingbird represents that Dart is a speedy language.


![Early hummingbird drawing](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/DartHummingbird.jpg)

However, hummingbirds are pointed and angular
and we wanted a cuddly plushy, so we chose a round
hummingbird.


Shams specified which color would go where,
the tail shape, the tuft of hair, the eyes...all the
little details. The vendor sent the specs to two
manufacturers who returned the prototypes some weeks later.


![The first Dash prototypes](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/dash-prototypes.jpg)![The first Dash prototypes](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/dash-prototypes2.jpg)

[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Introducing Dash at the January 2018 Dart Conference"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/R5vIUjRZaZA)

While the manufacturing process was proceeding,
Shams chose a name for the plushy: Dash,
because it was an early code name for the
Dart project, it was gender neutral,
and it seemed appropriate for a hummingbird.


Many boxes of Dash plushies arrived in
southern California just in time for the conference.
They were eagerly adopted by Dart _and_ Flutter enthusiasts.


The people have spoken, so Dash is now the mascot for Flutter **and** Dart.

Since the creation of Dash 1.0, we've made two more versions.
Marketing slightly changed the Dart and Flutter color scheme after
Dash 1.0 was created, so Dash 2.0 reflects the updated scheme
(which removed the green color).
Dash 2.1 is a smaller size and has a few more color
tweaks. The smaller size is easier to ship,
and fits better in a claw machine!

- Dash is female, but she doesn't mind
being called _they_, _their_, _he_, or _him_.

- Dash has an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/dash_the_dartlang_plushy/).

- Dash has a **straight** beak.
**Please, don't depict Dash with a curved beak.**

- We also have Mega-Dash, a life-sized mascot
who is currently resting in a Google office.

![Mega-Dash in the office](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/dash/MegaDashChilling.png)

Mega-Dash made her
first appearance at the [Flutter Interact](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU0o0wKRJTjyN0pSUA6TI8lg)
event
in Brooklyn, New York, on December 11, 2019.

[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Flutter performance tips \| Flutter in Focus"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/PKGguGUwSYE)

What is performance? Why is performance important? How do I improve performance?

Our goal is to answer those three questions (mainly the third one), and
anything related to them. This document should serve as the single entry
point or the root node of a tree of resources that addresses any questions
that you have about performance.


The answers to the first two questions are mostly philosophical,
and not as helpful to many developers who visit this page with specific
performance issues that need to be solved.
Therefore, the answers to those
questions are in the [appendix](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/appendix).


To improve performance, you first need metrics: some measurable numbers to
verify the problems and improvements.
In the [metrics](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/metrics) page,
you'll see which metrics are currently used,
and which tools and APIs are available to get the metrics.


There is a list of [Frequently asked questions](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/faq),
so you can find out if the questions you have or the problems you're having
were already answered or encountered, and whether there are existing solutions.
(Alternatively, you can check the Flutter GitHub issue database using the
[performance](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=+label%3A%22severe%3A+performance%22)
label.)


Finally, the performance issues are divided into four categories. They
correspond to the four labels that are used in the Flutter GitHub issue
database: " [perf: speed](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22perf%3A+speed%22+sort%3Aupdated-asc+)", " [perf: memory](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22perf%3A+memory%22+sort%3Aupdated-asc+)",
" [perf: app size](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22perf%3A+app+size%22+sort%3Aupdated-asc+)", " [perf: energy](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22perf%3A+energy%22+sort%3Aupdated-asc+)".

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

## Overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#overview)

The core of Flutter's layout mechanism is widgets.
In Flutter, almost everything is a widget—even
layout models are widgets. The images, icons,
and text that you see in a Flutter app are all widgets.
But things you don't see are also widgets,
such as the rows, columns, and grids that arrange,
constrain, and align the visible widgets.
You create a layout by composing widgets to build more
complex widgets.


## Conceptual example

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#conceptual-example)

In the following example, the first screenshot displays
three icons with labels and the second screenshot includes
the visual layout for rows and columns. In the second
screenshot, `debugPaintSizeEnabled` is set to `true` so you
can see the visual layout.


![Sample layout](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/lakes-icons.png)

![Sample layout with visual debugging](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/lakes-icons-visual.png)

Here's a diagram of the widget tree for the previous
example:


![Node tree](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/sample-flutter-layout.png)

Most of this should look as you might expect, but you might be wondering
about the containers (shown in pink). [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html)
is a widget class
that allows you to customize its child widget. Use a `Container` when
you want to add padding, margins, borders, or background color,
to name some of its capabilities.


Each [`Text`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) widget is placed in a
`Container`
to add margins. The entire [`Row`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html)
is also placed in a
`Container` to add padding around the row.


The rest of the UI is controlled by properties.
Set an [`Icon`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Icons-class.html)'s color using its
`color` property.
Use the `Text.style` property to set the font, its color, weight, and so on.
Columns and rows have properties that allow you to specify how their
children are aligned vertically or horizontally, and how much space
the children should occupy.


## Lay out a widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#lay-out-a-widget)

How do you lay out a single widget in Flutter? This section
shows you how to create and display a simple widget.
It also shows the entire code for a simple Hello World app.


In Flutter, it takes only a few steps to put text, an icon,
or an image on the screen.


### 1\. Select a layout widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#1-select-a-layout-widget)

Choose from a variety of [layout widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/layout) based
on how you want to align or constrain a visible widget,
as these characteristics are typically passed on to the
contained widget.


For example, you could use the
[`Center`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html)
layout widget to center a visible widget
horizontally and vertically:


dart

```
Center(
  // Content to be centered here.
)
```

content\_copy

### 2\. Create a visible widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#2-create-a-visible-widget)

Choose a [visible widget](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets) for your app to contain
visible elements, such as [text](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html),
[images](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Image-class.html), or
[icons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Icons-class.html).


For example, you could use the [`Text`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html)
widget display
some text:


dart

```
Text('Hello World')
```

content\_copy

### 3\. Add the visible widget to the layout widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#3-add-the-visible-widget-to-the-layout-widget)

All layout widgets have either of the following:

- A `child` property if they take a single child—for example,
`Center` or `Container`
- A `children` property if they take a list of widgets—for example,
`Row`, `Column`, `ListView`, or `Stack`.


Add the `Text` widget to the `Center` widget:

dart

```
const Center(
  child: Text('Hello World'),
),
```

content\_copy

### 4\. Add the layout widget to the page

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#4-add-the-layout-widget-to-the-page)

A Flutter app is itself a widget, and most widgets have a [`build()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget/build.html)

method. Instantiating and returning a widget in the app's `build()` method
displays the widget.


- [Standard apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#0-tab-panel)
- [Material apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#1-tab-panel)
- [Cupertino apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#2-tab-panel)

For a general app, you can add the `Container` widget to
the app's `build()` method:


dart

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      decoration: const BoxDecoration(color: Colors.white),
      child: const Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello World',
          textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 32, color: Colors.black87),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

By default, a general app doesn't include an `AppBar`,
title, or background color. If you want these features in a
general app, you have to build them yourself. This app
changes the background color to white and the text to
dark grey to mimic a Material app.


For a `Material` app, you can use a [`Scaffold`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html)
widget;
it provides a default banner, background color,
and has API for adding drawers, snack bars, and bottom sheets.
Then you can add the `Center` widget directly to the `body`

property for the home page.


dart

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    const String appTitle = 'Flutter layout demo';
    return MaterialApp(
      title: appTitle,
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text(appTitle)),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text('Hello World'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

To create a `Cupertino` app,
use the `CupertinoApp` and [`CupertinoPageScaffold`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoPageScaffold-class.html)
widgets.


Unlike `Material`, it doesn't provide a default banner or background color.
You need to set these yourself.


- To set default colors, pass in a configured [`CupertinoThemeData`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoThemeData-class.html)

to your app's `theme` property.

- To add an iOS-styled navigation bar to the top of your app, add a
[`CupertinoNavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoNavigationBar-class.html)
widget to the `navigationBar`
property of your scaffold.
You can use the colors that [`CupertinoColors`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoColors-class.html)
provides to
configure your widgets to match iOS design.

- To lay out the body of your app, set the `child` property of your scaffold
with the desired widget as its value, like `Center` or `Column`.


To learn what other UI components you can add, check out the
[Cupertino library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/cupertino-library.html).


dart

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const CupertinoApp(
      title: 'Flutter layout demo',
      theme: CupertinoThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.light,
        primaryColor: CupertinoColors.systemBlue,
      ),
      home: CupertinoPageScaffold(
        navigationBar: CupertinoNavigationBar(
          backgroundColor: CupertinoColors.systemGrey,
          middle: Text('Flutter layout demo'),
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [Text('Hello World')],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### 5\. Run your app

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#5-run-your-app)

After you've added your widgets, run your app. When you run
the app, you should see _Hello World_.

App source code:

- [Material app](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/base)
- [Non-Material app](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/non_material)

![Screenshot of app displaying Hello World](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/hello-world.png)

## Lay out multiple widgets vertically and horizontally

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#lay-out-multiple-widgets-vertically-and-horizontally)

One of the most common layout patterns is to arrange
widgets vertically or horizontally. You can use a
`Row` widget to arrange widgets horizontally,
and a `Column` widget to arrange widgets vertically.


To create a row or column in Flutter, you add a list of children
widgets to a [`Row`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html)
or [`Column`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html) widget. In turn,
each child can itself be a row or column, and so on.
The following example shows how it is possible to nest rows or
columns inside of rows or columns.


This layout is organized as a `Row`. The row contains two children:
a column on the left, and an image on the right:


![Screenshot with callouts showing the row containing two children](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/pavlova-diagram.png)

The left column's widget tree nests rows and columns.

![Diagram showing a left column broken down to its sub-rows and sub-columns](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/pavlova-left-column-diagram.png)

You'll implement some of Pavlova's layout code in
[Nesting rows and columns](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#nesting-rows-and-columns).


### Aligning widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#aligning-widgets)

You control how a row or column aligns its children using the
`mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment` properties.
For a row, the main axis runs horizontally and the cross axis runs
vertically. For a column, the main axis runs vertically and the cross
axis runs horizontally.


![Diagram showing the main axis and cross axis for a row](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/row-diagram.png)

![Diagram showing the main axis and cross axis for a column](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/column-diagram.png)

The [`MainAxisAlignment`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/MainAxisAlignment.html)
and [`CrossAxisAlignment`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/CrossAxisAlignment.html)

enums offer a variety of constants for controlling alignment.


In the following example, each of the 3 images is 100 pixels wide.
The render box (in this case, the entire screen)
is more than 300 pixels wide, so setting the main axis
alignment to `spaceEvenly` divides the free horizontal
space evenly between, before, and after each image.


dart

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
  children: [\
    Image.asset('images/pic1.jpg'),\
    Image.asset('images/pic2.jpg'),\
    Image.asset('images/pic3.jpg'),\
  ],
);
```

**App source:** [row\_column](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/row_column)

Columns work the same way as rows. The following example shows a column
of 3 images, each is 100 pixels high. The height of the render box
(in this case, the entire screen) is more than 300 pixels, so
setting the main axis alignment to `spaceEvenly` divides the free vertical
space evenly between, above, and below each image.


dart

```
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
  children: [\
    Image.asset('images/pic1.jpg'),\
    Image.asset('images/pic2.jpg'),\
    Image.asset('images/pic3.jpg'),\
  ],
);
```

### Sizing widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#sizing-widgets)

When a layout is too large to fit a device, a yellow
and black striped pattern appears along the affected edge.
Here is an [example](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/sizing)
of a row that is too wide:


![Overly-wide row](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/layout-too-large.png)

Widgets can be sized to fit within a row or column by using the
[`Expanded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html)
widget. To fix the previous example where the
row of images is too wide for its render box,
wrap each image with an `Expanded` widget.


dart

```
Row(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [\
    Expanded(child: Image.asset('images/pic1.jpg')),\
    Expanded(child: Image.asset('images/pic2.jpg')),\
    Expanded(child: Image.asset('images/pic3.jpg')),\
  ],
);
```

content\_copy

![Row of 3 images that are too wide, but each is constrained to take only 1/3 of the space](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/row-expanded-2-visual.png)

**App source:** [sizing](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/sizing)

Perhaps you want a widget to occupy twice as much space as its
siblings. For this, use the `Expanded` widget `flex` property,
an integer that determines the flex factor for a widget.
The default flex factor is 1. The following code sets
the flex factor of the middle image to 2:


dart

```
Row(
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [\
    Expanded(child: Image.asset('images/pic1.jpg')),\
    Expanded(flex: 2, child: Image.asset('images/pic2.jpg')),\
    Expanded(child: Image.asset('images/pic3.jpg')),\
  ],
);
```

**App source:** [sizing](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/sizing)

### Packing widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#packing-widgets)

By default, a row or column occupies as much space along its main axis
as possible, but if you want to pack the children closely together,
set its `mainAxisSize` to `MainAxisSize.min`. The following example
uses this property to pack the star icons together.


dart

```
Row(
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: [\
    Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),\
    Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),\
    Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),\
    const Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),\
    const Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),\
  ],
)
```

content\_copy

**App source:** [pavlova](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/pavlova)

### Nesting rows and columns

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#nesting-rows-and-columns)

The layout framework allows you to nest rows and columns
inside of rows and columns as deeply as you need.
Let's look at the code for the outlined
section of the following layout:


![Screenshot of the pavlova app, with the ratings and icon rows outlined in red](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/pavlova-large-annotated.png)

The outlined section is implemented as two rows. The ratings row contains
five stars and the number of reviews. The icons row contains three
columns of icons and text.


The widget tree for the ratings row:

![Ratings row widget tree](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/widget-tree-pavlova-rating-row.png)

The `ratings` variable creates a row containing a smaller row
of 5-star icons, and text:


dart

```
final stars = Row(
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: [\
    Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),\
    Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),\
    Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.green[500]),\
    const Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),\
    const Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.black),\
  ],
);
​
final ratings = Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
  child: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
    children: [\
      stars,\
      const Text(\
        '170 Reviews',\
        style: TextStyle(\
          color: Colors.black,\
          fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,\
          fontFamily: 'Roboto',\
          letterSpacing: 0.5,\
          fontSize: 20,\
        ),\
      ),\
    ],
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

The icons row, below the ratings row, contains 3 columns;
each column contains an icon and two lines of text,
as you can see in its widget tree:


![Icon widget tree](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/widget-tree-pavlova-icon-row.png)

The `iconList` variable defines the icons row:

dart

```
const descTextStyle = TextStyle(
  color: Colors.black,
  fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
  fontFamily: 'Roboto',
  letterSpacing: 0.5,
  fontSize: 18,
  height: 2,
);
​
// DefaultTextStyle.merge() allows you to create a default text
// style that is inherited by its child and all subsequent children.
final iconList = DefaultTextStyle.merge(
  style: descTextStyle,
  child: Container(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
    child: Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
      children: [\
        Column(\
          children: [\
            Icon(Icons.kitchen, color: Colors.green[500]),\
            const Text('PREP:'),\
            const Text('25 min'),\
          ],\
        ),\
        Column(\
          children: [\
            Icon(Icons.timer, color: Colors.green[500]),\
            const Text('COOK:'),\
            const Text('1 hr'),\
          ],\
        ),\
        Column(\
          children: [\
            Icon(Icons.restaurant, color: Colors.green[500]),\
            const Text('FEEDS:'),\
            const Text('4-6'),\
          ],\
        ),\
      ],
    ),
  ),
);
```

content\_copy

The `leftColumn` variable contains the ratings and icons rows,
as well as the title and text that describes the Pavlova:


dart

```
final leftColumn = Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(20, 30, 20, 20),
  child: Column(children: [titleText, subTitle, ratings, iconList]),
);
```

content\_copy

The left column is placed in a `SizedBox` to constrain its width.
Finally, the UI is constructed with the entire row (containing the
left column and the image) inside a `Card`.


The [Pavlova image](https://pixabay.com/en/photos/pavlova) is from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/en/photos/pavlova).
You can embed an image from the net using `Image.network()` but,
for this example, the image is saved to an images directory in the project,
added to the [pubspec file](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/pavlova/pubspec.yaml), and accessed using
`Images.asset()`.
For more information, see [Adding assets and images](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets/assets-and-images).


dart

```
body: Center(
  child: Container(
    margin: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(0, 40, 0, 30),
    height: 600,
    child: Card(
      child: Row(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [\
          SizedBox(width: 440, child: leftColumn),\
          mainImage,\
        ],
      ),
    ),
  ),
),

## Common layout widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#common-layout-widgets)

Flutter has a rich library of layout widgets.
Here are a few of those most commonly used.
The intent is to get you up and running as quickly as possible,
rather than overwhelm you with a complete list.
For information on other available widgets,
refer to the [Widget catalog](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets),
or use the Search box in the [API reference docs](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter).
Also, the widget pages in the API docs often make suggestions
about similar widgets that might better suit your needs.


The following widgets fall into two categories: standard widgets
from the [widgets library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/widgets-library.html), and specialized widgets from the
[Material library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html). Any app can use the widgets library but
only Material apps can use the Material Components library.


- [Standard widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#3-tab-panel)
- [Material widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#4-tab-panel)
- [Cupertino widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#5-tab-panel)

[`Container`](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#container)

Adds padding, margins, borders,
background color, or other decorations to a widget.


[`GridView`](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#gridview)

Lays widgets out as a scrollable grid.

[`ListView`](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#listview)

Lays widgets out as a scrollable list.

[`Stack`](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#stack)

Overlaps a widget on top of another.

[`Scaffold`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html)

Provides a structured layout framework
with slots for common Material Design app elements.


[`AppBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AppBar-class.html)

Creates a horizontal bar that's typically
displayed at the top of a screen.


[`Card`](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#card)

Organizes related info into a box with
rounded corners and a drop shadow.


[`ListTile`](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#listtile)

Organizes up to 3 lines of text,
and optional leading and trailing icons, into a row.


[`CupertinoPageScaffold`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoPageScaffold-class.html)

Provides the basic layout structure for an iOS-style page.

[`CupertinoNavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoNavigationBar-class.html)

Creates an iOS-style navigation bar at the top of the screen.

[`CupertinoSegmentedControl`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoSegmentedControl-class.html)

Creates a segmented control for selecting.

[`CupertinoTabBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoTabBar-class.html)
and
[`CupertinoTabScaffold`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/cupertino/CupertinoTabScaffold-class.html)

Creates the characteristic iOS bottom tab bar.

### Container

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#container)

Many layouts make liberal use of [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html) s to separate
widgets using padding, or to add borders or margins.
You can change the device's background by placing the
entire layout into a `Container` and changing its background
color or image.


#### Summary (Container)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#summary-container)

- Add padding, margins, borders
- Change background color or image
- Contains a single child widget, but that child can be a `Row`,
`Column`, or even the root of a widget tree

![Diagram showing: margin, border, padding, and content](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/margin-padding-border.png)

#### Examples (Container)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#examples-container)

This layout consists of a column with two rows, each containing
2 images. A [`Container`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html)
is used to change the background color
of the column to a lighter grey.


dart

```
Widget _buildImageColumn() {
  return Container(
    decoration: const BoxDecoration(color: Colors.black26),
    child: Column(children: [_buildImageRow(1), _buildImageRow(3)]),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

![Screenshot showing 2 rows, each containing 2 images](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/container.png)

A `Container` is also used to add a rounded border and margins
to each image:


dart

```
Widget _buildDecoratedImage(int imageIndex) => Expanded(
  child: Container(
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      border: Border.all(width: 10, color: Colors.black38),
      borderRadius: const BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(8)),
    ),
    margin: const EdgeInsets.all(4),
    child: Image.asset('images/pic$imageIndex.jpg'),
  ),
);
​
Widget _buildImageRow(int imageIndex) => Row(
  children: [\
    _buildDecoratedImage(imageIndex),\
    _buildDecoratedImage(imageIndex + 1),\
  ],
);
```

content\_copy

You can find more `Container` examples in the [tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial).

**App source:** [container](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/container)

### GridView

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#gridview)

Use [`GridView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html) to lay widgets out as a two-dimensional
list. `GridView` provides two pre-fabricated lists,
or you can build your own custom grid. When a `GridView`
detects that its contents are too long to fit the render box,
it automatically scrolls.


#### Summary (GridView)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#summary-gridview)

- Lays widgets out in a grid
- Detects when the column content exceeds the render box
and automatically provides scrolling

- Build your own custom grid, or use one of the provided grids:
  - `GridView.count` allows you to specify the number of columns
  - `GridView.extent` allows you to specify the maximum pixel
     width of a tile

#### Examples (GridView)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#examples-gridview)

![A 3-column grid of photos](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/gridview-extent.png)

Uses `GridView.extent` to create a grid with tiles a maximum
150 pixels wide.

**App source:** [grid\_and\_list](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/grid_and_list)

![A 2 column grid with footers](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/gridview-count-flutter-gallery.png)

Uses `GridView.count` to create a grid that's 2 tiles
wide in portrait mode, and 3 tiles wide in landscape mode.
The titles are created by setting the `footer` property for
each [`GridTile`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/GridTile-class.html).

**Dart code:** [`grid_list_demo.dart`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/gallery/lib/grid_list_demo.dart)

dart

```
Widget _buildGrid() => GridView.extent(
  maxCrossAxisExtent: 150,
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(4),
  mainAxisSpacing: 4,
  crossAxisSpacing: 4,
  children: _buildGridTileList(30),
);
​
// The images are saved with names pic0.jpg, pic1.jpg...pic29.jpg.
// The List.generate() constructor allows an easy way to create
// a list when objects have a predictable naming pattern.
List<Widget> _buildGridTileList(int count) =>
    List.generate(count, (i) => Image.asset('images/pic$i.jpg'));
```

### ListView

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#listview)

[`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html), a column-like widget, automatically
provides scrolling when its content is too long for
its render box.


#### Summary (ListView)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#summary-listview)

- A specialized [`Column`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html)
for organizing a list of boxes

- Can be laid out horizontally or vertically
- Detects when its content won't fit and provides scrolling
- Less configurable than `Column`, but easier to use and
supports scrolling


#### Examples (ListView)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#examples-listview)

![ListView containing movie theaters and restaurants](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/listview.png)

Uses `ListView` to display a list of businesses using
`ListTile`s. A `Divider` separates the theaters from
the restaurants.

**App source:** [grid\_and\_list](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/grid_and_list)

![ListView containing shades of blue](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/listview-color-gallery.png)

Uses `ListView` to display the [`Colors`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Colors-class.html) from
the [Material 2 Design palette](https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors)
for a particular color family.

**Dart code:** [`colors_demo.dart`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/gallery/lib/colors_demo.dart)

dart

```
Widget _buildList() {
  return ListView(
    children: [\
      _tile('CineArts at the Empire', '85 W Portal Ave', Icons.theaters),\
      _tile('The Castro Theater', '429 Castro St', Icons.theaters),\
      _tile('Alamo Drafthouse Cinema', '2550 Mission St', Icons.theaters),\
      _tile('Roxie Theater', '3117 16th St', Icons.theaters),\
      _tile(\
        'United Artists Stonestown Twin',\
        '501 Buckingham Way',\
        Icons.theaters,\
      ),\
      _tile('AMC Metreon 16', '135 4th St #3000', Icons.theaters),\
      const Divider(),\
      _tile('K\'s Kitchen', '757 Monterey Blvd', Icons.restaurant),\
      _tile('Emmy\'s Restaurant', '1923 Ocean Ave', Icons.restaurant),\
      _tile('Chaiya Thai Restaurant', '272 Claremont Blvd', Icons.restaurant),\
      _tile('La Ciccia', '291 30th St', Icons.restaurant),\
    ],
  );
}
​
ListTile _tile(String title, String subtitle, IconData icon) {
  return ListTile(
    title: Text(
      title,
      style: const TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w500, fontSize: 20),
    ),
    subtitle: Text(subtitle),
    leading: Icon(icon, color: Colors.blue[500]),
  );
}
```

### Stack

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#stack)

Use [`Stack`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html) to arrange widgets on top of a base
widget—often an image. The widgets can completely
or partially overlap the base widget.


#### Summary (Stack)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#summary-stack)

- Use for widgets that overlap another widget
- The first widget in the list of children is the base widget;
subsequent children are overlaid on top of that base widget

- A `Stack`'s content can't scroll
- You can choose to clip children that exceed the render box

#### Examples (Stack)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#examples-stack)

![Circular avatar image with a label](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/stack.png)

Uses `Stack` to overlay a `Container`
(that displays its `Text` on a translucent
black background) on top of a `CircleAvatar`.
The `Stack` offsets the text using the `alignment` property and
`Alignment`s.

**App source:** [card\_and\_stack](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/card_and_stack)

![An image with a icon overlaid on top](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/stack-flutter-gallery.png)

Uses `Stack` to overlay an icon on top of an image.

**Dart code:** [`bottom_navigation_demo.dart`](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/layout/gallery/lib/bottom_navigation_demo.dart)

dart

```
Widget _buildStack() {
  return Stack(
    alignment: const Alignment(0.6, 0.6),
    children: [\
      const CircleAvatar(\
        backgroundImage: AssetImage('images/pic.jpg'),\
        radius: 100,\
      ),\
      Container(\
        decoration: const BoxDecoration(color: Colors.black45),\
        child: const Text(\
          'Mia B',\
          style: TextStyle(\
            fontSize: 20,\
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,\
            color: Colors.white,\
          ),\
        ),\
      ),\
    ],
  );
}
```

### Card

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#card)

A [`Card`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Card-class.html), from the
[Material library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html),
contains related nuggets of information and can
be composed of almost any widget, but is often used with
[`ListTile`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html).
`Card` has a single child,
but its child can be a column, row, list, grid,
or other widget that supports multiple children.
By default, a `Card` shrinks its size to 0 by 0 pixels.
You can use [`SizedBox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SizedBox-class.html)
to constrain the size of a card.


In Flutter, a `Card` features slightly rounded corners
and a drop shadow, giving it a 3D effect.
Changing a `Card`'s `elevation` property allows you to control
the drop shadow effect. Setting the elevation to 24,
for example, visually lifts the `Card` further from the
surface and causes the shadow to become more dispersed.
For a list of supported elevation values, see [Elevation](https://m3.material.io/styles/elevation)
in the
[Material guidelines](https://m3.material.io/styles).
Specifying an unsupported value disables the drop shadow entirely.


#### Summary (Card)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#summary-card)

- Implements a [Material card](https://m3.material.io/components/cards)
- Used for presenting related nuggets of information
- Accepts a single child, but that child can be a `Row`,
`Column`, or other widget that holds a list of children

- Displayed with rounded corners and a drop shadow
- A `Card`'s content can't scroll
- From the [Material library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html)

#### Examples (Card)

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#examples-card)

![Card containing 3 ListTiles](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/card.png)

### ListTile

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout#listtile)

Use [`ListTile`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html), a specialized row widget from the
[Material library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html), for an easy way to create a row
containing up to 3 lines of text and optional leading
and trailing icons. `ListTile` is most commonly used in
[`Card`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Card-class.html)
or [`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html), but can be used elsewhere.

[vertical\_align\_topUse themes to share colors and font styles](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

To share colors and font styles throughout an app, use themes.

You can define app-wide themes.
You can extend a theme to change a theme style for one component.
Each theme defines the colors, type style, and other parameters
applicable for the type of Material component.


Flutter applies styling in the following order:

1. Styles applied to the specific widget.
2. Themes that override the immediate parent theme.
3. Main theme for the entire app.

After you define a `Theme`, use it within your own widgets.
Flutter's Material widgets use your theme to set the background
colors and font styles for app bars, buttons, checkboxes, and more.


## Create an app theme

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes#create-an-app-theme)

To share a `Theme` across your entire app, set the `theme` property
to your `MaterialApp` constructor.
This property takes a [`ThemeData`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html)
instance.


As of the Flutter 3.16 release, Material 3 is Flutter's
default theme.


If you don't specify a theme in the constructor,
Flutter creates a default theme for you.


dart

```
MaterialApp(
  title: appName,
  theme: ThemeData(
    // Define the default brightness and colors.
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
      seedColor: Colors.purple,
      // ···
      brightness: Brightness.dark,
    ),
​
    // Define the default `TextTheme`. Use this to specify the default
    // text styling for headlines, titles, bodies of text, and more.
    textTheme: TextTheme(
      displayLarge: const TextStyle(
        fontSize: 72,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
      ),
      // ···
      titleLarge: GoogleFonts.oswald(
        fontSize: 30,
        fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,
      ),
      bodyMedium: GoogleFonts.merriweather(),
      displaySmall: GoogleFonts.pacifico(),
    ),
  ),
  home: const MyHomePage(title: appName),
);
```

content\_copy

Most instances of `ThemeData` set values for the following two properties. These properties affect the entire app.


1. [`colorScheme`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData/colorScheme.html)
    defines the colors.

2. [`textTheme`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData/textTheme.html)
    defines text styling.


To learn what colors, fonts, and other properties, you can define,
check out the [`ThemeData`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html)
documentation.


## Apply a theme

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes#apply-a-theme)

To apply your new theme, use the `Theme.of(context)` method
when specifying a widget's styling properties.
These can include, but are not limited to, `style` and `color`.


The `Theme.of(context)` method looks up the widget tree and retrieves
the nearest `Theme` in the tree.
If you have a standalone `Theme`, that's applied.
If not, Flutter applies the app's theme.


In the following example, the `Container` constructor uses this technique to set its `color`.


dart

```
Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12, vertical: 12),
  color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary,
  child: Text(
    'Text with a background color',
    // ···
    style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium!.copyWith(
      color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onPrimary,
    ),
  ),
),
```

content\_copy

## Override a theme

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes#override-a-theme)

To override the overall theme in part of an app,
wrap that section of the app in a `Theme` widget.


You can override a theme in two ways:

1. Create a unique `ThemeData` instance.
2. Extend the parent theme.

### Set a unique `ThemeData` instance

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes#set-a-unique-themedata-instance)

If you want a component of your app to ignore the overall theme,
create a `ThemeData` instance.
Pass that instance to the `Theme` widget.


dart

```
Theme(
  // Create a unique theme with `ThemeData`.
  data: ThemeData(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.pink)),
  child: FloatingActionButton(onPressed: () {}, child: const Icon(Icons.add)),
);
```

content\_copy

### Extend the parent theme

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes#extend-the-parent-theme)

Instead of overriding everything, consider extending the parent theme.
To extend a theme, use the [`copyWith()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData/copyWith.html)
method.


dart

```
Theme(
  // Find and extend the parent theme using `copyWith`.
  // To learn more, check out the section on `Theme.of`.
  data: Theme.of(
    context,
  ).copyWith(colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.pink)),
  child: const FloatingActionButton(onPressed: null, child: Icon(Icons.add)),
);
```

[vertical\_align\_topConcurrency and isolates](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

All Dart code runs in [isolates](https://dart.dev/language/concurrency),
which are similar to threads,
but differ in that isolates have their own isolated memory.
They do not share state in any way,
and can only communicate by messaging.
By default,
Flutter apps do all of their work on a single isolate –
the main isolate.
In most cases, this model allows for simpler programming and
is fast enough that the application's UI doesn't become unresponsive.


Sometimes though,
applications need to perform exceptionally large computations
that can cause "UI jank" (jerky motion).
If your app is experiencing jank for this reason,
you can move these computations to a helper isolate.
This allows the underlying runtime environment
to run the computation concurrently
with the main UI isolate's work
and takes advantage of multi-core devices.


Each isolate has its own memory
and its own event loop.
The event loop processes
events in the order that they're added to an event queue.
On the main isolate,
these events can be anything from handling a user tapping in the UI,
to executing a function,
to painting a frame on the screen.
The following figure shows an example event queue
with 3 events waiting to be processed.


![The main isolate diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/concurrency/basics-main-isolate.png)

For smooth rendering,
Flutter adds a "paint frame" event to the event queue
60 times per second(for a 60Hz device).
If these events aren't processed on time,
the application experiences UI jank,
or worse,
become unresponsive altogether.


![Event jank diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/concurrency/event-jank.png)

Whenever a process can't be completed in a frame gap,
the time between two frames,
it's a good idea to offload the work to another isolate
to ensure that the main isolate can produce 60 frames per second.
When you spawn an isolate in Dart,
it can process the work concurrently with the main isolate,
without blocking it.


You can read more about how isolates
and the event loop work in Dart on
the [concurrency page](https://dart.dev/language/concurrency) of the Dart
documentation.


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Isolates and the event loop \| Flutter in Focus"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/vl_AaCgudcY)

## Common use cases for isolates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#common-use-cases-for-isolates)

There is only one hard rule for when you should use isolates,
and that's when large computations are causing your Flutter application
to experience UI jank.
This jank happens when there is any computation that takes longer than
Flutter's frame gap.


![Event jank diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/concurrency/event-jank.png)

Any process _could_ take longer to complete,
depending on the implementation
and the input data,
making it impossible to create an exhaustive list of
when you need to consider using isolates.


That said, isolates are commonly used for the following:

- Reading data from a local database
- Sending push notifications
- Parsing and decoding large data files
- Processing or compressing photos, audio files, and video files
- Converting audio and video files
- When you need asynchronous support while using FFI
- Applying filtering to complex lists or filesystems

## Message passing between isolates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#message-passing-between-isolates)

Dart's isolates are an implementation of the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).
They can only communicate with each other by message passing,
which is done with [`Port` objects](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/ReceivePort-class.html).
When messages are "passed" between each other,
they are generally copied from the sending isolate to the
receiving isolate.
This means that any value passed to an isolate,
even if mutated on that isolate,
doesn't change the value on the original isolate.


The only [objects that aren't copied when passed](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/SendPort/send.html)
to an isolate
are immutable objects that can't be changed anyway,
such a String or an unmodifiable byte.
When you pass an immutable object between isolates,
a reference to that object is sent across the port,
rather than the object being copied,
for better performance.
Because immutable objects can't be updated,
this effectively retains the actor model behavior.


An exception to this rule is
when an isolate exits when it sends a message using the `Isolate.exit` method.
Because the sending isolate won't exist after sending the message,
it can pass ownership of the message from one isolate to the other,
ensuring that only one isolate can access the message.


The two lowest-level primitives that send messages are `SendPort.send`,
which makes a copy of a mutable message as it sends,
and `Isolate.exit`,
which sends the reference to the message.
Both `Isolate.run` and `compute`
use `Isolate.exit` under the hood.


## Short-lived isolates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#short-lived-isolates)

The easiest way to move a process to an isolate in Flutter is with
the `Isolate.run` method.
This method spawns an isolate,
passes a callback to the spawned isolate to start some computation,
returns a value from the computation,
and then shuts the isolate down when the computation is complete.
This all happens concurrently with the main isolate,
and doesn't block it.


![Isolate diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/development/concurrency/isolate-bg-worker.png)

The `Isolate.run` method requires a single argument,
a callback function,
that is run on the new isolate.
This callback's function signature must have exactly
one required, unnamed argument.
When the computation completes,
it returns the callback's value back to the main isolate,
and exits the spawned isolate.


For example,
consider this code that loads a large JSON blob from a file,
and converts that JSON into custom Dart objects.
If the json decoding process wasn't off loaded to a new isolate,
this method would cause the UI to
become unresponsive for several seconds.


dart

```
// Produces a list of 211,640 photo objects.
// (The JSON file is ~20MB.)
Future<List<Photo>> getPhotos() async {
  final String jsonString = await rootBundle.loadString('assets/photos.json');
  final List<Photo> photos = await Isolate.run<List<Photo>>(() {
    final List<Object?> photoData = jsonDecode(jsonString) as List<Object?>;
    return photoData.cast<Map<String, Object?>>().map(Photo.fromJson).toList();
  });
  return photos;
}
```

parse JSON in the background, see [this cookbook recipe](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/background-parsing).


## Stateful, longer-lived isolates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#stateful-longer-lived-isolates)

Short-live isolates are convenient to use,
but there is performance overhead required to spawn new isolates,
and to copy objects from one isolate to another.
If you're doing the same computation using `Isolate.run` repeatedly,
you might have better performance by creating isolates that don't exit immediately.


To do this, you can use a handful of lower-level isolate-related APIs that
`Isolate.run` abstracts:


- [`Isolate.spawn()`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/Isolate/spawn.html) and [`Isolate.exit()`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/Isolate/exit.html)
- [`ReceivePort`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/ReceivePort-class.html) and [`SendPort`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/SendPort-class.html)
- [`send()`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/SendPort/send.html) method

When you use the `Isolate.run` method,
the new isolate immediately shuts down after it
returns a single message to the main isolate.
Sometimes, you'll need isolates that are long lived,
and can pass multiple messages to each other over time.
In Dart, you can accomplish this with the Isolate API
and Ports.
These long-lived isolates are colloquially known as _background workers_.


Long-lived isolates are useful when you have a specific process that either
needs to be run repeatedly throughout the lifetime of your application,
or if you have a process that runs over a period of time
and needs to yield multiple return values to the main isolate.


Or, you might use [worker\_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/worker_manager) to manage long-lived isolates.


### ReceivePorts and SendPorts

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#receiveports-and-sendports)

Set up long-lived communication between isolates with two classes
(in addition to Isolate):
[`ReceivePort`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/ReceivePort-class.html)
and [`SendPort`](https://api.dart.dev/dart-isolate/SendPort-class.html).
These ports are the only way isolates can communicate with each other.


`Ports` behave similarly to `Streams`,
in which the `StreamController`
or `Sink` is created in one isolate,
and the listener is set up in the other isolate.
In this analogy,
the `StreamConroller` is called a `SendPort`,
and you can "add" messages with the `send()` method.
`ReceivePort`s are the listeners,
and when these listeners receive a new message,
they call a provided callback with the message as an argument.


For an in-depth explanation on setting up two-way
communication between the main isolate
and a worker isolate,
follow the examples in the [Dart documentation](https://dart.dev/language/concurrency).


## Using platform plugins in isolates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#using-platform-plugins-in-isolates)

As of Flutter 3.7, you can use platform plugins in background isolates.
This opens many possibilities to offload heavy,
platform-dependent computations to an isolate that won't block your UI.
For example, imagine you're encrypting data
using a native host API
(such as an Android API on Android, an iOS API on iOS, and so on).
Previously, [marshaling data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science))
to the host platform could waste UI thread time,
and can now be done in a background isolate.


Platform channel isolates use the [`BackgroundIsolateBinaryMessenger`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/BackgroundIsolateBinaryMessenger-class.html)
API.
The following snippet shows an example of using
the `shared_preferences` package in a background isolate.


dart

```
import 'dart:isolate';
​
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
​
void main() {
  // Identify the root isolate to pass to the background isolate.
  RootIsolateToken rootIsolateToken = RootIsolateToken.instance!;
  Isolate.spawn(_isolateMain, rootIsolateToken);
}
​
Future<void> _isolateMain(RootIsolateToken rootIsolateToken) async {
  // Register the background isolate with the root isolate.
  BackgroundIsolateBinaryMessenger.ensureInitialized(rootIsolateToken);
​
  // You can now use the shared_preferences plugin.
  SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
​
  print(sharedPreferences.getBool('isDebug'));
}
```

## Limitations of Isolates

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#limitations-of-isolates)

If you're coming to Dart from a language with multithreading,
it's reasonable to expect isolates to behave like threads,
but that isn't the case.
Isolates have their own global fields,
and can only communicate with message passing,
ensuring that mutable objects in an isolate are only ever accessible
in a single isolate.
Therefore, isolates are limited by their access to their own memory.
For example,
if you have an application with a global mutable variable called `configuration`,
it is copied as a new global field in a spawned isolate.
If you mutate that variable in the spawned isolate,
it remains untouched in the main isolate.
This is true even if you pass the `configuration` object as a message
to the new isolate.
This is how isolates are meant to function,
and it's important to keep in mind when you consider using isolates.


### Web platforms and compute

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#web-platforms-and-compute)

Dart web platforms, including Flutter web,
don't support isolates.
If you're targeting the web with your Flutter app,
you can use the `compute` method to ensure your code compiles.
The [`compute()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/compute.html)
method runs the computation on
the main thread on the web,
but spawns a new thread on mobile devices.
On mobile and desktop platforms
`await compute(fun, message)`
is equivalent to `await Isolate.run(() => fun(message))`.


For more information on concurrency on the web,
check out the [concurrency documentation](https://dart.dev/language/concurrency)
on dart.dev.


### No `rootBundle` access or `dart:ui` methods

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#no-rootbundle-access-or-dart-ui-methods)

All UI tasks and Flutter itself are coupled to the main isolate.
Therefore,
you can't access assets using `rootBundle` in spawned isolates,
nor can you perform any widget
or UI work in spawned isolates.


### Limited plugin messages from host platform to Flutter

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/isolates#limited-plugin-messages-from-host-platform-to-flutter)

With background isolate platform channels,
you can use platform channels in isolates to send messages to the host platform
(for example Android or iOS),
and receive responses to those messages.
However, you can't receive unsolicited messages from the host platform.


As an example,
you can't set up a long-lived Firestore listener in a background isolate,
because Firestore uses platform channels to push updates to Flutter,
which are unsolicited.
You can, however, query Firestore for a response in the background.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This document explains how to listen for, and respond to,
_gestures_ in Flutter.
Examples of gestures include taps, drags, and scaling.


The gesture system in Flutter has two separate layers.
The first layer has raw pointer events that describe
the location and movement of pointers (for example,
touches, mice, and styli) across the screen.
The second layer has _gestures_ that describe semantic
actions that consist of one or more pointer movements.


## Pointers

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/gestures#pointers)

Pointers represent raw data about the user's interaction
with the device's screen.
There are four types of pointer events:


[`PointerDownEvent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/PointerDownEvent-class.html)

The pointer has contacted the screen at a particular location.

[`PointerMoveEvent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/PointerMoveEvent-class.html)

The pointer has moved from one location on the screen to another.

[`PointerUpEvent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/PointerUpEvent-class.html)

The pointer has stopped contacting the screen.

[`PointerCancelEvent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/PointerCancelEvent-class.html)

Input from this pointer is no longer directed towards this app.

On pointer down, the framework does a _hit test_ on your app
to determine which widget exists at the location where the
pointer contacted the screen. The pointer down event
(and subsequent events for that pointer) are then dispatched
to the innermost widget found by the hit test.
From there, the events bubble up the tree and are dispatched
to all the widgets on the path from the innermost
widget to the root of the tree. There is no mechanism for
canceling or stopping pointer events from being dispatched further.


To listen to pointer events directly from the widgets layer, use a
[`Listener`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Listener-class.html)
widget. However, generally,
consider using gestures (as discussed below) instead.


## Gestures

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/gestures#gestures)

Gestures represent semantic actions (for example, tap, drag,
and scale) that are recognized from multiple individual pointer
events, potentially even multiple individual pointers.
Gestures can dispatch multiple events, corresponding to the
lifecycle of the gesture (for example, drag start,
drag update, and drag end):


**Tap**

`onTapDown`

A pointer that might cause a tap has contacted
the screen at a particular location.


`onTapUp`

A pointer that triggers a tap has stopped contacting
the screen at a particular location.


`onTap`

The pointer that previously triggered the `onTapDown`
has also triggered `onTapUp` which ends up causing a tap.


`onTapCancel`

The pointer that previously triggered the `onTapDown`
won't end up causing a tap.


**Double tap**

`onDoubleTap`

The user has tapped the screen at the same location twice in
quick succession.


**Long press**

`onLongPress`

A pointer has remained in contact with the
screen at the same location for a long period of time.


**Vertical drag**

`onVerticalDragStart`

A pointer has contacted the screen and might begin to
move vertically.


`onVerticalDragUpdate`

A pointer that is in contact with the screen and
moving vertically has moved in the vertical direction.


`onVerticalDragEnd`

A pointer that was previously in contact with the screen
and moving vertically is no longer in contact with the
screen and was moving at a specific velocity when it
stopped contacting the screen.


**Horizontal drag**

`onHorizontalDragStart`

A pointer has contacted the screen and might begin to
move horizontally.


`onHorizontalDragUpdate`

A pointer that is in contact with the screen and
moving horizontally has moved in the horizontal direction.


`onHorizontalDragEnd`

A pointer that was previously in contact with the
screen and moving horizontally is no longer in contact
with the screen and was moving at a specific velocity
when it stopped contacting the screen.


**Pan**

`onPanStart`

A pointer has contacted the screen and might begin to move
horizontally or vertically. This callback crashes if
`onHorizontalDragStart` or `onVerticalDragStart` is set.


`onPanUpdate`

A pointer that is in contact with the screen and is moving
in the vertical or horizontal direction. This callback
crashes if `onHorizontalDragUpdate` or `onVerticalDragUpdate`

is set.


`onPanEnd`

A pointer that was previously in contact with screen
is no longer in contact with the screen and is moving
at a specific velocity when it stopped contacting the screen.
This callback crashes if `onHorizontalDragEnd` or
`onVerticalDragEnd` is set.


### Adding gesture detection to widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/gestures#adding-gesture-detection-to-widgets)

To listen to gestures from the widgets layer,
use a [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html).


If you're using Material Components,
many of those widgets already respond to taps or gestures.
For example, [`IconButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html)
and [`TextButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextButton-class.html)

respond to presses (taps), and [`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)

responds to swipes to trigger scrolling.
If you aren't using those widgets, but you want the
"ink splash" effect on a tap, you can use [`InkWell`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InkWell-class.html).


### Gesture disambiguation

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity/gestures#gesture-disambiguation)

At a given location on screen,
there might be multiple gesture detectors.
For example:


- A `ListTile` has a tap recognizer that responds
to the entire `ListTile`, and a nested one around
a trailing icon button. The screen rect of the
trailing icon is now covered by two gesture
recognizers that need to negotiate for who handles
the gesture if it turns out to be a tap.

- A single `GestureDetector` covers a screen area
configured to handle multiple gestures,
such as a long press and a tap.
The `tap` recognizer must now negotiate
with the `long press` recognizer when
the user touches that part of the screen.
Depending on what happens next with that pointer,
one of the two recognizers receives the gesture,
or neither receives the gesture if the user
performs something that's neither a tap nor a long press.


All of these gesture detectors listen to the stream
of pointer events as they flow past and attempt to recognize
specific gestures. The [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
widget decides
which gestures to attempt to recognize based on which of its
callbacks are non-null.


When there is more than one gesture recognizer for a given
pointer on the screen, the framework disambiguates which
gesture the user intends by having each recognizer join
the _gesture arena_. The gesture arena determines which
gesture wins using the following rules:


- At any time, a recognizer can eliminate itself and leave the
arena. If there's only one recognizer left in the arena,
that recognizer wins.

- At any time, a recognizer can declare itself the winner,
causing all of the remaining recognizers to lose.


For example, when disambiguating horizontal and vertical dragging,
both recognizers enter the arena when they receive the pointer
down event. The recognizers observe the pointer move events.
If the user moves the pointer more than a certain number of
logical pixels horizontally, the horizontal recognizer declares
the win and the gesture is interpreted as a horizontal drag.
Similarly, if the user moves more than a certain number of logical
pixels vertically, the vertical recognizer declares itself the winner.


The gesture arena is beneficial when there is only a horizontal
(or vertical) drag recognizer. In that case, there is only one
recognizer in the arena and the horizontal drag is recognized
immediately, which means the first pixel of horizontal movement
can be treated as a drag and the user won't need to wait for
further gesture disambiguation.

[vertical\_align\_topCreate a staggered menu animation](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/staggered-menu-animation#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

A single app screen might contain multiple animations.
Playing all of the animations at the same time can be
overwhelming. Playing the animations one after the other
can take too long. A better option is to stagger the animations.
Each animation begins at a different time,
but the animations overlap to create a shorter duration.
In this recipe, you build a drawer menu with animated
content that is staggered and has a button that pops
in at the bottom.


The following animation shows the app's behavior:

![Staggered Menu Animation Example](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/cookbook/effects/StaggeredMenuAnimation.webp)

## Create the menu without animations

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/staggered-menu-animation#create-the-menu-without-animations)

The drawer menu displays a list of titles,
followed by a Get started button at
the bottom of the menu.


Define a stateful widget called `Menu`
that displays the list and button
in static locations.


dart

```
class Menu extends StatefulWidget {
  const Menu({super.key});
​
  @override
  State<Menu> createState() => _MenuState();
}
​
class _MenuState extends State<Menu> {
  static const _menuTitles = [\
    'Declarative Style',\
    'Premade Widgets',\
    'Stateful Hot Reload',\
    'Native Performance',\
    'Great Community',\
  ];
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      color: Colors.white,
      child: Stack(
        fit: StackFit.expand,
        children: [_buildFlutterLogo(), _buildContent()],
      ),
    );
  }
​
  Widget _buildFlutterLogo() {
    // TODO: We'll implement this later.
    return Container();
  }
​
  Widget _buildContent() {
    return Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [\
        const SizedBox(height: 16),\
        ..._buildListItems(),\
        const Spacer(),\
        _buildGetStartedButton(),\
      ],
    );
  }
​
  List<Widget> _buildListItems() {
    final listItems = <Widget>[];
    for (var i = 0; i < _menuTitles.length; ++i) {
      listItems.add(
        Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 36, vertical: 16),
          child: Text(
            _menuTitles[i],
            textAlign: TextAlign.left,
            style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.w500),
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
    return listItems;
  }
​
  Widget _buildGetStartedButton() {
    return SizedBox(
      width: double.infinity,
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(24),
        child: ElevatedButton(
          style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
            shape: const StadiumBorder(),
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 48, vertical: 14),
          ),
          onPressed: () {},
          child: const Text(
            'Get Started',
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 22),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Prepare for animations

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/staggered-menu-animation#prepare-for-animations)

Control of the animation timing requires an
`AnimationController`.


Add the `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`
to the `MenuState` class. Then, declare and
instantiate an `AnimationController`.


dart

```
class _MenuState extends State<Menu> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _staggeredController;
​
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
​
    _staggeredController = AnimationController(vsync: this);
  }
​
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _staggeredController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The length of the delay before every animation is
up to you. Define the animation delays,
individual animation durations, and the total
animation duration.


dart

```
class _MenuState extends State<Menu> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  static const _initialDelayTime = Duration(milliseconds: 50);
  static const _itemSlideTime = Duration(milliseconds: 250);
  static const _staggerTime = Duration(milliseconds: 50);
  static const _buttonDelayTime = Duration(milliseconds: 150);
  static const _buttonTime = Duration(milliseconds: 500);
  final _animationDuration =
      _initialDelayTime +
      (_staggerTime * _menuTitles.length) +
      _buttonDelayTime +
      _buttonTime;
}
```

content\_copy

In this case, all the animations are delayed by 50 ms.
After that, list items begin to appear.
Each list item's appearance is delayed by 50 ms after the
previous list item begins to slide in.
Each list item takes 250 ms to slide from right to left.
After the last list item begins to slide in,
the button at the bottom waits another 150 ms to pop in.
The button animation takes 500 ms.


With each delay and animation duration defined,
the total duration is calculated so that it can be
used to calculate the individual animation times.


The desired animation times are shown in the following diagram:

![Animation Timing Diagram](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/cookbook/effects/TimingDiagram.png)

To animate a value during a subsection of a larger animation,
Flutter provides the `Interval` class.
An `Interval` takes a start time percentage and an end
time percentage. That `Interval` can then be used to
animate a value between those start and end times,
instead of using the entire animation's start and
end times. For example, given an animation that takes 1 second,
an interval from 0.2 to 0.5 would start at 200 ms
(20%) and end at 500 ms (50%).


Declare and calculate each list item's `Interval` and the
bottom button `Interval`.


dart

```
class _MenuState extends State<Menu> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  final List<Interval> _itemSlideIntervals = [];
  late Interval _buttonInterval;
​
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
​
    _createAnimationIntervals();
​
    _staggeredController = AnimationController(
      vsync: this,
      duration: _animationDuration,
    );
  }
​
  void _createAnimationIntervals() {
    for (var i = 0; i < _menuTitles.length; ++i) {
      final startTime = _initialDelayTime + (_staggerTime * i);
      final endTime = startTime + _itemSlideTime;
      _itemSlideIntervals.add(
        Interval(
          startTime.inMilliseconds / _animationDuration.inMilliseconds,
          endTime.inMilliseconds / _animationDuration.inMilliseconds,
        ),
      );
    }
​
    final buttonStartTime =
        Duration(milliseconds: _menuTitles.length * 50) + _buttonDelayTime;
    final buttonEndTime = buttonStartTime + _buttonTime;
    _buttonInterval = Interval(
      buttonStartTime.inMilliseconds / _animationDuration.inMilliseconds,
      buttonEndTime.inMilliseconds / _animationDuration.inMilliseconds,
    );
  }
}
```

content\_copy

## Animate the list items and button

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/effects/staggered-menu-animation#animate-the-list-items-and-button)

The staggered animation plays as soon as the menu becomes visible.

Start the animation in `initState()`.

dart

```
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
​
  _createAnimationIntervals();
​
  _staggeredController = AnimationController(
    vsync: this,
    duration: _animationDuration,
  )..forward();
}
```

content\_copy

Each list item slides from right to left and
fades in at the same time.


Use the list item's `Interval` and an `easeOut`
curve to animate the opacity and translation
values for each list item.


dart

```
List<Widget> _buildListItems() {
  final listItems = <Widget>[];
  for (var i = 0; i < _menuTitles.length; ++i) {
    listItems.add(
      AnimatedBuilder(
        animation: _staggeredController,
        builder: (context, child) {
          final animationPercent = Curves.easeOut.transform(
            _itemSlideIntervals[i].transform(_staggeredController.value),
          );
          final opacity = animationPercent;
          final slideDistance = (1.0 - animationPercent) * 150;
​
          return Opacity(
            opacity: opacity,
            child: Transform.translate(
              offset: Offset(slideDistance, 0),
              child: child,
            ),
          );
        },
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 36, vertical: 16),
          child: Text(
            _menuTitles[i],
            textAlign: TextAlign.left,
            style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.w500),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
  return listItems;
}
```

content\_copy

Use the same approach to animate the opacity and
scale of the bottom button. This time, use an
`elasticOut` curve to give the button a springy effect.


dart

```
Widget _buildGetStartedButton() {
  return SizedBox(
    width: double.infinity,
    child: Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(24),
      child: AnimatedBuilder(
        animation: _staggeredController,
        builder: (context, child) {
          final animationPercent = Curves.elasticOut.transform(
            _buttonInterval.transform(_staggeredController.value),
          );
          final opacity = animationPercent.clamp(0.0, 1.0);
          final scale = (animationPercent * 0.5) + 0.5;
​
          return Opacity(
            opacity: opacity,
            child: Transform.scale(scale: scale, child: child),
          );
        },
        child: ElevatedButton(
          style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
            shape: const StadiumBorder(),
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 48, vertical: 14),
          ),
          onPressed: () {},
          child: const Text(
            'Get Started',
            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 22),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

content\_copy

Congratulations!
You have an animated menu where the appearance of each
list item is staggered, followed by a bottom button that
pops into place.

[vertical\_align\_topNavigation and routing](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Flutter provides a complete system for navigating between screens and handling
deep links. Small applications without complex deep linking can use
[`Navigator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html), while apps with specific deep linking and navigation
requirements should also use the [`Router`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router-class.html)
to correctly handle deep links on
Android and iOS, and to stay in sync with the address bar when the app is
running on the web.


To configure your Android or iOS application to handle deep links, see
[Deep linking](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation/deep-linking).


## Using the Navigator

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#using-the-navigator)

The `Navigator` widget displays screens as a stack using the correct transition
animations for the target platform. To navigate to a new screen, access the
`Navigator` through the route's `BuildContext` and call imperative methods such
as `push()``or pop()`:


dart

```
child: const Text('Open second screen'),
onPressed: () {
  Navigator.of(context).push(
    MaterialPageRoute<void>(
      builder: (context) => const SecondScreen(),
    ),
  );
},
```

content\_copy

Because `Navigator` keeps a stack of `Route` objects (representing the history
stack), The `push()` method also takes a `Route` object. The
`MaterialPageRoute`
object is a subclass of `Route` that specifies the transition animations for
Material Design. For more examples of how to use the `Navigator`, follow the
[navigation recipes](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation) from the Flutter Cookbook or
visit the [Navigator API documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html).


## Using named routes

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#using-named-routes)

Applications with simple navigation and deep linking requirements can use the
`Navigator` for navigation and the [`MaterialApp.routes`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/routes.html)
parameter for deep
links:


dart

```
child: const Text('Open second screen'),
onPressed: () {
  Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second');
},
```

content\_copy

`/second` represents a _named route_ that was declared in the
`MaterialApp.routes` list. For a complete example, follow the
[Navigate with named routes](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/navigation/named-routes) recipe from the Flutter Cookbook.


### Limitations

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#limitations)

Although named routes can handle deep links, the behavior is always the same and
can't be customized. When a new deep link is received by the platform, Flutter
pushes a new `Route` onto the Navigator regardless of where the user currently is.


Flutter also doesn't support the browser forward button for applications using
named routes. For these reasons, we don't recommend using named routes in most
applications. Instead, use a routing package like [go\_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
or
use `Navigator` with [`MaterialPageRoute`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialPageRoute-class.html).


## Using the Router

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#using-the-router)

Flutter applications with advanced navigation and routing requirements (such as
a web app that uses direct links to each screen, or an app with multiple
`Navigator` widgets) should use a routing package such as [go\_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
that can
parse the route path and configure the `Navigator` whenever the app receives a
new deep link.


To use the Router, switch to the `router` constructor on `MaterialApp` or
`CupertinoApp` and provide it with a `Router` configuration. Routing packages,
such as [go\_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router), typically provide route configuration and routes
can be used as follows:


dart

```
child: const Text('Open second screen'),
onPressed: () => context.go('/second'),
```

content\_copy

Because packages like go\_router are _declarative_, they will always display the
same screen(s) when a deep link is received.


## Using Router and Navigator together

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#using-router-and-navigator-together)

The `Router` and `Navigator` are designed to work together. You can navigate
using the `Router` API through a declarative routing package, such as
`go_router`, or by calling imperative methods such as `push()`
and `pop()` on
the `Navigator`.


When you navigate using the `Router` or a declarative routing package, each
route on the Navigator is _page-backed_, meaning it was created from a
[`Page`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Page-class.html)
using the [`pages`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator/pages.html)

argument on the `Navigator` constructor. Conversely, any `Route`

created by calling `Navigator.push` or `showDialog` will add a
_pageless_
route to the Navigator. If you are using a routing package, Routes that are
_page-backed_ are always deep-linkable, whereas _pageless_ routes
are not.


When a _page-backed_`Route` is removed from the `Navigator`, all of the
_pageless_ routes after it are also removed. For example, if a deep link
navigates by removing a _page-backed_ route from the Navigator, all _pageless_

routes after (up until the next _page-backed_ route) are removed too.


## Web support

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#web-support)

Apps using the `Router` class integrate with the browser History API to provide
a consistent experience when using the browser's back and forward buttons.
Whenever you navigate using the `Router`, a History API entry is added to the
browser's history stack. Pressing the **back** button uses _[reverse\_\
_chronological navigation](https://material.io/design/navigation/understanding-navigation.html#reverse-navigation)_, meaning that the user is taken to the previously
visited location that was shown using the `Router`. This means that if the user
pops a page from the `Navigator` and then presses the browser **back**
button
the previous page is pushed back onto the stack.

listOn this pagechevron\_rightUse the CPU profiler view

[vertical\_align\_topUse the CPU profiler view](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

The CPU profiler view allows you to record and profile a
session from your Dart or Flutter application.
The profiler can help you solve performance problems
or generally understand your app's CPU activity.
The Dart VM collects CPU samples
(a snapshot of the CPU call stack at a single point in time)
and sends the data to DevTools for visualization.
By aggregating many CPU samples together,
the profiler can help you understand where the CPU
spends most of its time.


## CPU profiler

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#cpu-profiler)

Start recording a CPU profile by clicking **Record**.
When you are done recording, click **Stop**. At this point,
CPU profiling data is pulled from the VM and displayed
in the profiler views (Call tree, Bottom up, Method table,
and Flame chart).


To load all available CPU samples without manually
recording and stopping, you can click **Load all CPU samples**,
which pulls all CPU samples that the VM has recorded and
stored in its sample buffer and then
displays those CPU samples in the profiler view.


By default, the VM's sample buffer is used as a ring buffer,
meaning that once it has become full, new samples start
overwriting the oldest ones in the buffer.
To make the VM instead discard all samples collected after
the sample buffer has become full,
pass the `--profile-startup` flag to `dart run` or `flutter run`.


### Bottom up

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#bottom-up)

This table provides a bottom-up representation
of a CPU profile. This means that each top-level method,
or root, in the bottom up table is actually the
top method in the call stack for one or more CPU samples.
In other words, each top-level method in a bottom up
table is a leaf node from the top down table
(the call tree).
In this table, a method can be expanded to show its _callers_.


This view is useful for identifying expensive _methods_
in a CPU profile. When a root node in this table
has a high _self_ time, that means that many CPU samples
in this profile ended with that method on top of the call stack.


![Screenshot of the Bottom up view](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/bottom-up-view.png)

See the [Guidelines](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#guidelines) section below to learn how to
enable the blue and green vertical lines seen in this image.


Tooltips can help you understand the values in each column:

**Total time**

For top-level methods in the bottom-up tree

(stack frames that were at the top of at least one
CPU sample), this is the time the method spent executing
its own code, as well as the code for any methods that
it called.


**Self time**

For top-level methods in the bottom-up tree

(stack frames that were at the top of at least one CPU
sample), this is the time the method spent executing only
its own code.

For children methods in the bottom-up tree (the callers),
this is the self time of the top-level method (the callee)
when called through the child method (the caller).


**Table element** (self time)
![Screenshot of a bottom up table](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/table-element.png)

### Call tree

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#call-tree)

This table provides a top-down representation of a CPU profile.
This means that each top-level method in the call tree is a root
of one or more CPU samples. In this table,
a method can be expanded to show its _callees_.


This view is useful for identifying expensive _paths_ in a CPU profile.
When a root node in this table has a high _total_ time,
that means that many CPU samples in this profile started
with that method on the bottom of the call stack.


![Screenshot of a call tree table](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/call-tree.png)
See the [Guidelines](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#guidelines) section below to learn how to
enable the blue and green vertical lines seen in this image.


Tooltips can help you understand the values in each column:

**Total time**

Time that a method spent executing its own code as well as

the code for any methods it called.

**Self time**

Time the method spent executing only its own code.

### Method table

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#method-table)

The method table provides CPU statistics for each method
contained in a CPU profile. In the table on the left,
all available methods are listed with their **total** and
**self** time.


**Total** time is the combined time that a method spent
**anywhere** on the call stack, or in other words,
the time a method spent executing its own code and
any code for methods that it called.


**Self** time is the combined time that a method spent
on top of the call stack, or in other words,
the time a method spent executing only its own code.


![Screenshot of a call tree table](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/method-table.png)

Selecting a method from the table on the left shows
the call graph for that method. The call graph shows
a method's callers and callees and their respective
caller / callee percentages.


### Flame chart

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#flame-chart)

The flame chart view is a graphical representation of
the [Call tree](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#call-tree). This is a top-down view
of a CPU profile, so in this chart,
the top-most method calls the one below it.
The width of each flame chart element represents the
amount of time that a method spent on the call stack.


Like the Call tree, this view is useful for identifying
expensive paths in a CPU profile.


![Screenshot of a flame chart](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/cpu-flame-chart.png)

The help menu, which can be opened by clicking the `?` icon
next to the search bar, provides information about how to
navigate and zoom within the chart and a color-coded legend.
![Screenshot of flame chart help](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/flame-chart-help.png)

### CPU sampling rate

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#cpu-sampling-rate)

DevTools sets a rate at which the VM collects CPU samples:
1 sample / 250 μs (microseconds).
This is selected by default on
the CPU profiler page as "Cpu sampling rate: medium".
This rate can be modified using the selector at the top
of the page.


![Screenshot of cpu sampling rate menu](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/cpu-sampling-rate-menu.png)

The **low**, **medium**, and **high** sampling rates are
1,000 Hz, 4,000 Hz, and 20,000 Hz, respectively.
It's important to know the trade-offs
of modifying this setting.


A profile that was recorded with a **higher** sampling rate
yields a more fine-grained CPU profile with more samples.
This might affect performance of your app since the VM
is being interrupted more often to collect samples.
This also causes the VM's CPU sample buffer to overflow more quickly.
The VM has limited space where it can store CPU sample information.
At a higher sampling rate, the space fills up and begins
to overflow sooner than it would have if a lower sampling
rate was used.
This means that you might not have access to CPU samples
from the beginning of the recorded profile, depending
on whether the buffer overflows during the time of recording.


A profile that was recorded with a lower sampling rate
yields a more coarse-grained CPU profile with fewer samples.
This affects your app's performance less,
but you might have access to less information about what
the CPU was doing during the time of the profile.
The VM's sample buffer also fills more slowly, so you can see
CPU samples for a longer period of app run time.
This means that you have a better chance of viewing CPU
samples from the beginning of the recorded profile.


### Filtering

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#filtering)

When viewing a CPU profile, you can filter the data by
library, method name, or [`UserTag`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-developer/UserTag-class.html).


![Screenshot of filter by tag menu](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/filter-by-tag.png)

## Guidelines

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/cpu-profiler#guidelines)

When looking at a call tree or bottom up view,
sometimes the trees can be very deep.
To help with viewing parent-child relationships in a deep tree,
enable the **Display guidelines** option.
This adds vertical guidelines between parent and child in the tree.


![Screenshot of display options](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/display-options.png)

[vertical\_align\_topFetch data from the internet](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Fetching data from the internet is necessary for most apps.
Luckily, Dart and Flutter provide tools, such as the
`http` package, for this type of work.


This recipe uses the following steps:

1. Add the `http` package.
2. Make a network request using the `http` package.
3. Convert the response into a custom Dart object.
4. Fetch and display the data with Flutter.

## 1\. Add the `http` package

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#1-add-the-http-package)

The [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package provides the
simplest way to fetch data from the internet.


To add the `http` package as a dependency,
run `flutter pub add`:


```
$ flutter pub add http
```

content\_copy

Import the http package.

dart

```
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
```

content\_copy

If you are deploying to Android, edit your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to
add the Internet permission.


xml

```
<!-- Required to fetch data from the internet. -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

content\_copy

Likewise, if you are deploying to macOS, edit your
`macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements`

files to include the network client entitlement.


xml

```
<!-- Required to fetch data from the internet. -->
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```

content\_copy

## 2\. Make a network request

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#2-make-a-network-request)

This recipe covers how to fetch a sample album from the
[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) using the [`http.get()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/get.html)
method.


dart

```
Future<http.Response> fetchAlbum() {
  return http.get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1'));
}
```

content\_copy

The `http.get()` method returns a `Future` that contains a `Response`.


- [`Future`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Future-class.html) is a core Dart class for working with
async operations. A Future object represents a potential
value or error that will be available at some time in the future.

- The `http.Response` class contains the data received from a successful
http call.


## 3\. Convert the response into a custom Dart object

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#3-convert-the-response-into-a-custom-dart-object)

While it's easy to make a network request, working with a raw
`Future<http.Response>` isn't very convenient.
To make your life easier,
convert the `http.Response` into a Dart object.


### Create an `Album` class

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#create-an-album-class)

First, create an `Album` class that contains the data from the
network request. It includes a factory constructor that
creates an `Album` from JSON.


Converting JSON using [pattern matching](https://dart.dev/language/patterns) is only one option.
For more information, see the full article on
[JSON and serialization](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/serialization/json).


dart

```
class Album {
  final int userId;
  final int id;
  final String title;
​
  const Album({required this.userId, required this.id, required this.title});
​
  factory Album.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return switch (json) {
      {'userId': int userId, 'id': int id, 'title': String title} => Album(
        userId: userId,
        id: id,
        title: title,
      ),
      _ => throw const FormatException('Failed to load album.'),
    };
  }
}
```

content\_copy

### Convert the `http.Response` to an `Album`

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#convert-the-http-response-to-an-album)

Now, use the following steps to update the `fetchAlbum()`
function to return a `Future<Album>`:


1. Convert the response body into a JSON `Map` with
    the `dart:convert` package.

2. If the server does return an OK response with a status code of
    200, then convert the JSON `Map` into an `Album`
    using the `fromJson()` factory method.

3. If the server does not return an OK response with a status code of 200,
    then throw an exception.
    (Even in the case of a "404 Not Found" server response,
    throw an exception. Do not return `null`.
    This is important when examining
    the data in `snapshot`, as shown below.)


dart

```
Future<Album> fetchAlbum() async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1'),
  );
​
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // If the server did return a 200 OK response,
    // then parse the JSON.
    return Album.fromJson(jsonDecode(response.body) as Map<String, dynamic>);
  } else {
    // If the server did not return a 200 OK response,
    // then throw an exception.
    throw Exception('Failed to load album');
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Hooray!
Now you've got a function that fetches an album from the internet.


## 4\. Fetch the data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#4-fetch-the-data)

Call the `fetchAlbum()` method in either the
[`initState()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/initState.html)
or [`didChangeDependencies()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/didChangeDependencies.html)

methods.


The `initState()` method is called exactly once and then never again.
If you want to have the option of reloading the API in response to an
[`InheritedWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html)
changing, put the call into the
`didChangeDependencies()` method.
See [`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html)
for more details.


dart

```
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  late Future<Album> futureAlbum;
​
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    futureAlbum = fetchAlbum();
  }
  // ···
}
```

content\_copy

This Future is used in the next step.

## 5\. Display the data

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#5-display-the-data)

To display the data on screen, use the
[`FutureBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html)
widget.
The `FutureBuilder` widget comes with Flutter and
makes it easy to work with asynchronous data sources.


You must provide two parameters:

1. The `Future` you want to work with.
    In this case, the future returned from
    the `fetchAlbum()` function.

2. A `builder` function that tells Flutter
    what to render, depending on the
    state of the `Future`: loading, success, or error.


Note that `snapshot.hasData` only returns `true`
when the snapshot contains a non-null data value.


Because `fetchAlbum` can only return non-null values,
the function should throw an exception
even in the case of a "404 Not Found" server response.
Throwing an exception sets the `snapshot.hasError` to `true`

which can be used to display an error message.


Otherwise, the spinner will be displayed.

dart

```
FutureBuilder<Album>(
  future: futureAlbum,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.hasData) {
      return Text(snapshot.data!.title);
    } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
      return Text('${snapshot.error}');
    }
​
    // By default, show a loading spinner.
    return const CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
)
```

content\_copy

## Why is fetchAlbum() called in initState()?

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#why-is-fetchalbum-called-in-initstate)

Although it's convenient,
it's not recommended to put an API call in a `build()` method.


Flutter calls the `build()` method every time it needs
to change anything in the view,
and this happens surprisingly often.
The `fetchAlbum()` method, if placed inside `build()`, is repeatedly
called on each rebuild causing the app to slow down.


Storing the `fetchAlbum()` result in a state variable ensures that
the `Future` is executed only once and then cached for subsequent
rebuilds.


## Testing

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/networking/fetch-data#testing)

For information on how to test this functionality,
see the following recipes:


- [Introduction to unit testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction)
- [Mock dependencies using Mockito](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking)

## Complete example

dart

```
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';
​
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

​
Future<Album> fetchAlbum() async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1'),
  );
​
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // If the server did return a 200 OK response,
    // then parse the JSON.
    return Album.fromJson(jsonDecode(response.body) as Map<String, dynamic>);
  } else {
    // If the server did not return a 200 OK response,
    // then throw an exception.
    throw Exception('Failed to load album');
  }
}
​
class Album {

[vertical\_align\_topError handling with Result objects](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/result#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

Dart provides a built-in error handling mechanism
with the ability to throw and catch exceptions.


As mentioned in the [Error handling documentation](https://dart.dev/language/error-handling),
Dart's exceptions are unhandled exceptions.
This means that methods that throw exceptions don’t need to declare them,
and calling methods aren't required to catch them either.


This can lead to situations where exceptions are not handled properly.
In large projects,
developers might forget to catch exceptions,
and the different application layers and components
could throw exceptions that aren’t documented.
This can lead to errors and crashes.


In this guide,
you will learn about this limitation
and how to mitigate it using the _result_ pattern.


## Error flow in Flutter applications

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/result#error-flow-in-flutter-applications)

Applications following the [Flutter architecture guidelines](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture)
are usually composed of view models,
repositories, and services, among other parts.
When a function in one of these components fails,
it should communicate the error to the calling component.


Typically, that's done with exceptions.
For example,
an API client service failing to communicate with the remote server
might throw an HTTP Error Exception.
The calling component,
for example a Repository,
would have to either capture this exception
or ignore it and let the calling view model handle it.


This can be observed in the following example. Consider these classes:

- A service, `ApiClientService`, performs API calls to a remote service.
- A repository, `UserProfileRepository`,
provides the `UserProfile` provided by the `ApiClientService`.

- A view model, `UserProfileViewModel`, uses the `UserProfileRepository`.

The `ApiClientService` contains a method, `getUserProfile`,
that throws exceptions in certain situations:


- The method throws an `HttpException` if the response code isn’t 200.
- The JSON parsing method throws an exception
if the response isn't formatted correctly.

- The HTTP client might throw an exception due to networking issues.

The following code tests for a variety of possible exceptions:

dart

```
class ApiClientService {
  // ···
​
  Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async {
    try {
      final request = await client.get(_host, _port, '/user');
      final response = await request.close();
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final stringData = await response.transform(utf8.decoder).join();
        return UserProfile.fromJson(jsonDecode(stringData));
      } else {
        throw const HttpException('Invalid response');
      }
    } finally {
      client.close();
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The `UserProfileRepository` doesn’t need to handle
the exceptions from the `ApiClientService`.
In this example, it just returns the value from the API Client.


dart

```
class UserProfileRepository {
  // ···
​
  Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async {
    return await _apiClientService.getUserProfile();
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Finally, the `UserProfileViewModel`
should capture all exceptions and handle the errors.


This can be done by wrapping
the call to the `UserProfileRepository` with a try-catch:


dart

```
class UserProfileViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  // ···
​
  Future<void> load() async {
    try {
      _userProfile = await userProfileRepository.getUserProfile();
      notifyListeners();
    } on Exception catch (exception) {
      // handle exception
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

In reality, a developer might forget to properly capture exceptions and
end up with the following code.
It compiles and runs, but crashes if
one of the exceptions mentioned previously occurs:


dart

```
class UserProfileViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  // ···
​
  Future<void> load() async {
    _userProfile = await userProfileRepository.getUserProfile();
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

content\_copy

You can attempt to solve this by documenting the `ApiClientService`,
warning about the possible exceptions it might throw.
However, since the view model doesn’t use the service directly,
other developers working in the codebase might miss this information.


## Using the result pattern

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/result#using-the-result-pattern)

An alternative to throwing exceptions
is to wrap the function output in a `Result` object.


When the function runs successfully,
the `Result` contains the returned value.
However, if the function does not complete successfully,
the `Result` object contains the error.


A `Result` is a [`sealed`](https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed)
class
that can either subclass `Ok` or the `Error` class.
Return the successful value with the subclass `Ok`,
and the captured error with the subclass `Error`.


The following code shows a sample `Result` class that
has been simplified for demo purposes.
A full implementation is at the end of this page.


dart

```
/// Utility class that simplifies handling errors.
///
/// Return a [Result] from a function to indicate success or failure.
///
/// A [Result] is either an [Ok] with a value of type [T]
/// or an [Error] with an [Exception].
///
/// Use [Result.ok] to create a successful result with a value of type [T].
/// Use [Result.error] to create an error result with an [Exception].
sealed class Result<T> {
  const Result();
​
  /// Creates an instance of Result containing a value
  factory Result.ok(T value) => Ok(value);
​
  /// Create an instance of Result containing an error
  factory Result.error(Exception error) => Error(error);
}
​
/// Subclass of Result for values
final class Ok<T> extends Result<T> {
  const Ok(this.value);
​
  /// Returned value in result
  final T value;
}
​
/// Subclass of Result for errors
final class Error<T> extends Result<T> {
  const Error(this.error);
​
  /// Returned error in result
  final Exception error;
}
```

content\_copy

In this example,
the `Result` class uses a generic type `T` to represent any return value,
which can be a primitive Dart type like `String` or an `int`
or a custom class like `UserProfile`.


### Creating a `Result` object

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/result#creating-a-result-object)

For functions using the `Result` class to return values,
instead of a value,
the function returns a `Result` object containing the value.


For example, in the `ApiClientService`,
`getUserProfile` is changed to return a `Result`:


dart

```
class ApiClientService {
  // ···
​
  Future<Result<UserProfile>> getUserProfile() async {
    // ···
  }
}
```

content\_copy

Instead of returning the `UserProfile` directly,
it returns a `Result` object containing a `UserProfile`.


To facilitate using the `Result` class,
it contains two named constructors, `Result.ok` and `Result.error`.
Use them to construct the `Result` depending on desired output.
As well, capture any exceptions thrown by the code
and wrap them into the `Result` object.


For example, here the `getUserProfile()` method
has been changed to use the `Result` class:


dart

```
class ApiClientService {
  // ···
​
  Future<Result<UserProfile>> getUserProfile() async {
    try {
      final request = await client.get(_host, _port, '/user');
      final response = await request.close();
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final stringData = await response.transform(utf8.decoder).join();
        return Result.ok(UserProfile.fromJson(jsonDecode(stringData)));
      } else {
        return const Result.error(HttpException('Invalid response'));
      }
    } on Exception catch (exception) {
      return Result.error(exception);
    } finally {
      client.close();
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The original return statement was replaced
with a statement that returns the value using `Result.ok`.
The `throw HttpException()`
was replaced with a statement that returns `Result.error(HttpException())`,
wrapping the error into a `Result`.
As well, the method is wrapped with a `try-catch` block
to capture any exceptions thrown by the Http client
or the JSON parser into a `Result.error`.


The repository class also needs to be modified,
and instead of returning a `UserProfile` directly,
now it returns a `Result<UserProfile>`.


dart

```
Future<Result<UserProfile>> getUserProfile() async {
  return await _apiClientService.getUserProfile();
}
```

content\_copy

### Unwrapping the Result object

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/result#unwrapping-the-result-object)

Now the view model doesn't receive the `UserProfile` directly,
but instead it receives a `Result` containing a `UserProfile`.


This forces the developer implementing the view model
to unwrap the `Result` to obtain the `UserProfile`,
and avoids having uncaught exceptions.


dart

```
class UserProfileViewModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  // ···
​
  UserProfile? userProfile;
​
  Exception? error;
​
  Future<void> load() async {
    final result = await userProfileRepository.getUserProfile();
    switch (result) {
      case Ok<UserProfile>():
        userProfile = result.value;
      case Error<UserProfile>():
        error = result.error;
    }
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

content\_copy

The `Result` class is implemented using a `sealed` class,
meaning it can only be of type `Ok` or `Error`.
This allows the code to evaluate the result with a
[switch result or expression](https://dart.dev/language/branches#switch-statements).


In the `Ok<UserProfile>` case,
obtain the value using the `value` property.


In the `Error<UserProfile>` case,
obtain the error object using the `error` property.


## Improving control flow

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/result#improving-control-flow)

Wrapping code in a `try-catch` block ensures that
thrown exceptions are caught and not propagated to other parts of the code.


Consider the following code.

dart

```
class UserProfileRepository {
  // ···
​
  Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async {
    try {
      return await _apiClientService.getUserProfile();
    } catch (e) {
      try {
        return await _databaseService.createTemporaryUser();
      } catch (e) {
        throw Exception('Failed to get user profile');
      }
    }
  }
}
```

content\_copy

In this method, the `UserProfileRepository`
attempts to obtain the `UserProfile`
using the `ApiClientService`.
If it fails, it tries to create a temporary user in a `DatabaseService`.


Because either service method can fail,
the code must catch the exceptions in both cases.


This can be improved using the `Result` pattern:

dart

```
Future<Result<UserProfile>> getUserProfile() async {
  final apiResult = await _apiClientService.getUserProfile();
  if (apiResult is Ok) {
    return apiResult;
  }
​
  final databaseResult = await _databaseService.createTemporaryUser();
  if (databaseResult is Ok) {
    return databaseResult;
  }
​
  return Result.error(Exception('Failed to get user profile'));
}
```

content\_copy

In this code, if the `Result` object is an `Ok` instance,
then the function returns that object;
otherwise, it returns `Result.Error`.


## Putting it all together

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/design-patterns/result#putting-it-all-together)

In this guide, you have learned
how to use a `Result` class to return result values.


The key takeaways are:

- `Result` classes force the calling method to check for errors,
reducing the amount of bugs caused by uncaught exceptions.

- `Result` classes help improve control flow compared to try-catch blocks.
- `Result` classes are `sealed` and can only return `Ok` or `Error`
instances,
allowing the code to unwrap them with a switch statement.


Below you can find the full `Result` class
as implemented in the [Compass App example](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/main/compass_app)

for the [Flutter architecture guidelines](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture).


dart

````
/// Utility class that simplifies handling errors.
///

/// Use [Result.error] to create an error result with an [Exception].
///
/// Evaluate the result using a switch statement:

/// }
/// ```
sealed class Result<T> {
  const Result();
​
  /// Creates a successful [Result], completed with the specified [value].
  const factory Result.ok(T value) = Ok._;
​
  /// Creates an error [Result], completed with the specified [error].
  const factory Result.error(Exception error) = Error._;
}
​
/// A successful [Result] with a returned [value].
final class Ok<T> extends Result<T> {
  const Ok._(this.value);
​
  /// The returned value of this result.
  final T value;
​
  @override
  String toString() => 'Result<$T>.ok($value)';
}
​
/// An error [Result] with a resulting [error].
final class Error<T> extends Result<T> {
  const Error._(this.error);
​
  /// The resulting error of this result.
  final Exception error;
​
  @override
  String toString() => 'Result<$T>.error($error)';
}

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of releasing a
Flutter app to the [App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/submissions/)
and [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/).


## Preliminaries

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#preliminaries)

Xcode is required to build and release your app. You
must use a device running macOS to follow this guide.


Before beginning the process of releasing your app,
ensure that it meets Apple's [App Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/).


To publish your app to the App Store,
you must first enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).
You can read more about the various membership options in Apple's
[Choosing a Membership](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/)
guide.


## Video overview

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#video-overview)

For those who prefer video over text,
the following video covers the same material as this guide.


[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Release an iOS app built with Flutter in 7 steps"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/iE2bpP56QKc)

## Register your app on App Store Connect

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#register-your-app-on-app-store-connect)

Manage your app's life cycle on
[App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/)
(formerly iTunes Connect).
You define your app name and description, add screenshots,
set pricing, and manage releases to the App Store and TestFlight.


Registering your app involves two steps: registering a unique
Bundle ID, and creating an application record on App Store Connect.


For a detailed overview of App Store Connect, see the
[App Store Connect](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/)
guide.


### Register a Bundle ID

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#register-a-bundle-id)

Every iOS application is associated with a Bundle ID,
a unique identifier registered with Apple.
To register a Bundle ID for your app, follow these steps:


1. Open the [App IDs](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle) page of your developer account.

2. Click **+** to create a new Bundle ID.
3. Enter an app name, select **Explicit App ID**, and enter an ID.
4. Select the services your app uses, then click **Continue**.
5. On the next page, confirm the details and click **Register**
    to register your Bundle ID.


### Create an application record on App Store Connect

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#create-an-application-record-on-app-store-connect)

Register your app on App Store Connect:

1. Open [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) in your browser.
2. On the App Store Connect landing page, click **Apps**.
3. Click **+** in the top-left corner,
    then select **New App**.

4. Fill in your app details in the form that appears.
    In the Platforms section, ensure that iOS is checked.
    Since Flutter does not currently support tvOS,
    leave that checkbox unchecked. Click **Create**.

5. Navigate to the application details for your app and select
    **App Information** from the sidebar.

6. In the General Information section, select the Bundle ID
    you registered in the preceding step.


For a detailed overview, see
[Add an app to your account](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev2cd126805).


## Review Xcode project settings

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#review-xcode-project-settings)

This step covers reviewing the most important settings
in the Xcode workspace.
For detailed procedures and descriptions, see
[Prepare for app distribution](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev91fe7130a).


Navigate to your target's settings in Xcode:

1. Open the default Xcode workspace in your project by running
    `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in a terminal window from your
    Flutter project directory.

2. To view your app's settings, select the **Runner** target in the
    Xcode navigator.


Verify the most important settings.

In the **Identity** section of the **General** tab:

`Display Name`

The display name of your app.

`Bundle Identifier`

The App ID you registered on App Store Connect.

In the **Signing & Capabilities** tab:

`Automatically manage signing`

Whether Xcode should automatically manage app signing
and provisioning. This is set `true` by default, which should
be sufficient for most apps. For more complex scenarios,
see the [Code Signing Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html).


`Team`

Select the team associated with your registered Apple Developer
account. If required, select **Add Account...**,
then update this setting.


In the **Deployment** section of the **Build Settings** tab:

`iOS Deployment Target`

The minimum iOS version that your app supports.
Flutter supports iOS 13 and later. If your app or plugins
include Objective-C or Swift code that makes use of APIs newer
than iOS 12, update this setting to the highest required version.


The **General** tab of your project settings should resemble
the following:


![Xcode Project Settings](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/releaseguide/xcode_settings.png)

For a detailed overview of app signing, see
[Create, export, and delete signing certificates](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev154b28f09).


## Add an app icon

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#add-an-app-icon)

When a new Flutter app is created, a placeholder icon set is created.
This step covers replacing these placeholder icons with your
app's icons:


1. Review the [iOS App Icon](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons/)
    guidelines and,
    in particular, the advice on
    [creating light, dark, and tinted](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#iOS-iPadOS)
    icons for your app.

2. In the Xcode project navigator, select `Assets.xcassets` in the
    `Runner` folder. Update the placeholder icons with your own app icons.

3. Verify the icon has been replaced by running your app using
    `flutter run`.


## Add a launch image

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#add-a-launch-image)

Similar to the app icon,
you can also replace the placeholder launch image:


1. In the Xcode project navigator,
    select `Assets.xcassets` in the `Runner` folder.
    Update the placeholder launch image with your own launch image.

2. Verify the new launch image by hot restarting your app.
    (Don't use `hot reload`.)


## Create a build archive and upload to App Store Connect

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#create-a-build-archive-and-upload-to-app-store-connect)

During development, you've been building, debugging, and testing
with _debug_ builds. When you're ready to ship your app to users
on the App Store or TestFlight, you need to prepare a _release_ build.


### Update the app's build and version numbers

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#update-the-apps-build-and-version-numbers)

The default version number of the app is `1.0.0`.
To update it, navigate to the `pubspec.yaml` file
and update the following line:


yaml

```
version: 1.0.0+1
```

content\_copy

The version number is three numbers separated by dots,
such as `1.0.0` in the example above, followed by an optional
build number such as `1` in the example above, separated by a `+`.


Both the version and the build number can be overridden in
`flutter build ipa` by specifying `--build-name` and `--build-number`,
respectively.


In iOS, `build-name` uses `CFBundleShortVersionString`
while `build-number` uses `CFBundleVersion`.
Read more about iOS versioning at [Core Foundation Keys](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html)

on the Apple Developer's site.


You can also override the `pubspec.yaml` build name and number in Xcode:

1. Open `Runner.xcworkspace` in your app's `ios` folder.
2. Select **Runner** in the Xcode project navigator, then select the
    **Runner** target in the settings view sidebar.

3. In the Identity section, update the **Version** to the user-facing
    version number you wish to publish.

4. In the Identity section, update the **Build** identifier to a unique
    build number used to track this build on App Store Connect.
    Each upload requires a unique build number.


### Create an app bundle

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#create-an-app-bundle)

Run `flutter build ipa` to produce an Xcode build archive (`.xcarchive` file)
in your project's `build/ios/archive/` directory and an App Store app
bundle (`.ipa` file) in `build/ios/ipa`.


Consider adding the `--obfuscate` and `--split-debug-info` flags to
[obfuscate your Dart code](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/obfuscate) to make it more difficult
to reverse engineer.


If you are not distributing to the App Store, you can optionally
choose a different [export method](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev31de635e5)
by
adding the option `--export-method ad-hoc`,
`--export-method development` or `--export-method enterprise`.


### Upload the app bundle to App Store Connect

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#upload-the-app-bundle-to-app-store-connect)

Once the app bundle is created, upload it to
[App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) by either:


1. Install and open the [Apple Transport macOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transporter/id1450874784).
Drag and drop the `build/ios/ipa/*.ipa` app bundle into the app.

2. Or upload the app bundle from the command line by running:



bash

```
xcrun altool --upload-app --type ios -f build/ios/ipa/*.ipa --apiKey your_api_key --apiIssuer your_issuer_id
```

content\_copy



Run `man altool` for details about how to authenticate with the App Store Connect API key.

3. Or open `build/ios/archive/MyApp.xcarchive` in Xcode.

Click the **Validate App** button. If any issues are reported,
address them and produce another build. You can reuse the same
build ID until you upload an archive.

After the archive has been successfully validated, click
**Distribute App**.


You can follow the status of your build in the
Activities tab of your app's details page on
[App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).
You should receive an email within 30 minutes notifying you that
your build has been validated and is available to release to testers
on TestFlight. At this point you can choose whether to release
on TestFlight, or go ahead and release your app to the App Store.

[Upload an app to App Store Connect](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev442d7f2ca).


## Create a build archive with Codemagic CLI tools

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#create-a-build-archive-with-codemagic-cli-tools)

This step covers creating a build archive and uploading
your build to App Store Connect using Flutter build commands
and [Codemagic CLI Tools](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools)
executed in a terminal
in the Flutter project directory. This allows you to create a build archive
with full control of distribution certificates in a temporary keychain
isolated from your login keychain.


01. Install the Codemagic CLI tools:



    bash

    ```
    pip3 install codemagic-cli-tools
    ```

    content\_copy

02. You'll need to generate an [App Store Connect API Key](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api)
    with App Manager access to automate operations with App Store Connect. To make
    subsequent commands more concise, set the following environment variables from
    the new key: issuer id, key id, and API key file.



    bash

    ```
    export APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee
    export APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER=ABC1234567
    export APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY=`cat /path/to/api/key/AuthKey_XXXYYYZZZ.p8`
    ```

    content\_copy

03. You need to export or create an iOS Distribution certificate to code sign and package a build archive.

    If you have existing [certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates), you can export the
    private keys by executing the following command for each certificate:



    bash

    ```
    openssl pkcs12 -in <certificate_name>.p12 -nodes -nocerts | openssl rsa -out cert_key
    ```

    content\_copy



    Or you can create a new private key by executing the following command:



    bash

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f cert_key -q -N ""
    ```

    content\_copy



    Later, you can have CLI tools automatically create a new iOS Distribution from the private key.

04. Set up a new temporary keychain to be used for code signing:



    bash

    ```
    keychain initialize
    ```

    content\_copy

05. Fetch the code signing files from App Store Connect:



    bash

    ```
    app-store-connect fetch-signing-files $(xcode-project detect-bundle-id) \
        --platform IOS \
        --type IOS_APP_STORE \
        --certificate-key=@file:/path/to/cert_key \
        --create
    ```

    content\_copy



    Where `cert_key` is either your exported iOS Distribution certificate private key
    or a new private key which automatically generates a new certificate. The certificate
    will be created from the private key if it doesn't exist in App Store Connect.

06. Now add the fetched certificates to your keychain:



    bash

    ```
    keychain add-certificates
    ```

    content\_copy

07. Update the Xcode project settings to use fetched code signing profiles:



    bash

    ```
    xcode-project use-profiles
    ```

    content\_copy

08. Install Flutter dependencies:



    bash

    ```
    flutter packages pub get
    ```

    content\_copy

09. Install CocoaPods dependencies:



    bash

    ```
    find . -name "Podfile" -execdir pod install \;
    ```

    content\_copy

10. Build the Flutter the iOS project:



    bash

    ```
    flutter build ipa --release \
        --export-options-plist=$HOME/export_options.plist
    ```

    content\_copy



    Note that `export_options.plist` is the output of the `xcode-project use-profiles` command.

11. Publish the app to App Store Connect:



    bash

    ```
    app-store-connect publish \
        --path $(find $(pwd) -name "*.ipa")
    ```

    content\_copy

12. As mentioned earlier, don't forget to set your login keychain
    as the default to avoid authentication issues
    with apps on your machine:



    bash

    ```
    keychain use-login
    ```

    content\_copy


You should receive an email within 30 minutes notifying you that
your build has been validated and is available to release to testers
on TestFlight. At this point you can choose whether to release
on TestFlight, or go ahead and release your app to the App Store.


## Release your app on TestFlight

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#release-your-app-on-testflight)

[TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) allows developers to push their apps
to internal and external testers. This optional step
covers releasing your build on TestFlight.


1. Navigate to the TestFlight tab of your app's application
    details page on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/).

2. Select **Internal Testing** in the sidebar.
3. Select the build to publish to testers, then click **Save**.
4. Add the email addresses of any internal testers.
    You can add additional internal users in the **Users and Roles**
    page of App Store Connect,
    available from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.


For more details, see
[Distribute an app using TestFlight](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev2539d985f).


## Release your app to the App Store

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios#release-your-app-to-the-app-store)

When you're ready to release your app to the world,
follow these steps to submit your app for review and
release to the App Store:


1. Select **Pricing and Availability** from the sidebar of your app's
    application details page on
    [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) and complete the
    required information.

2. Select the status from the sidebar. If this is the first
    release of this app, its status is
    **1.0 Prepare for Submission**. Complete all required fields.

3. Click **Submit for Review**.

Apple notifies you when their app review process is complete.
Your app is released according to the instructions you
specified in the **Version Release** section.


For more details, see
[Distribute an app through the App Store](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev067853c94).

[vertical\_align\_topGeneral approach to adaptive apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general#site-content-title)

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

So, just _how_ do you approach taking an app
designed for conventional mobile devices,
and make it beautiful on a wide range
of devices? What steps are required?


Google engineers, who have experience doing this
very thing for large apps, recommend the
following 3-step approach.


## Step 1: Abstract

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general#step-1-abstract)

![Step 1: Abstract info common to any UI widget](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/abstract.png)

First, identify the widgets that you plan to
make dynamic. Analyze the constructors for those
widgets and abstract out the data that you can share.


Common widgets that require adaptability are:

- Dialogs, both fullscreen and modal
- Navigation UI, both rail and bottom bar
- Custom layout, such as "is the UI area taller or wider?"

For example, in a `Dialog` widget, you can share
the info that contains the _content_ of the dialog.


Or, perhaps you want to switch between a
`NavigationBar` when the app window is small,
and a `NavigationRail` when the app window is large.
These widgets would likely share a list of
navigable destinations. In this case,
you might create a `Destination` widget to hold
this info, and specify the `Destination` as having both
an icon and a text label.


Next, you will evaluate your screen size to decide
on how to display your UI.


## Step 2: Measure

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general#step-2-measure)

![Step 2: How to measure screen size](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/measure.png)

You have two ways to determine the size of your display area:
`MediaQuery` and `LayoutBuilder`.


### MediaQuery

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general#mediaquery)

In the past, you might have used `MediaQuery.of` to
determine the size of the device's screen.
However, devices today feature screens
with a wide variety of sizes and shapes,
and this test can be misleading.


For example, maybe your app currently occupies a
small window on a large screen. If you use the
`MediaQuery.of` method and conclude the screen to be small
(when, in fact, the app displays in a tiny window on a large screen),
and you've portrait locked your app, it causes the
app's window to lock to the center of the
screen, surrounded with black.
This is hardly an ideal UI on a large screen.


Keep in mind that `MediaQuery.sizeOf` returns the
current size of the app's entire screen and
not just a single widget.


You have two ways to measure your screen space.
You can use either `MediaQuery.sizeOf` or `LayoutBuilder`,
depending on whether you want the size of the whole
app window, or more local sizing.


If you want your widget to be fullscreen,
even when the app window is small,
use `MediaQuery.sizeOf` so you can choose the
UI based on the size of the app window itself.
In the previous section, you want to base the
sizing behavior on the entire app's window,
so you would use `MediaQuery.sizeOf`.


Requesting the size of the app window from inside
the `build` method, as in `MediaQuery.sizeOf(context)`,
causes the given `BuildContext` to rebuild any time
the size property changes.


### LayoutBuilder

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general#layoutbuilder)

`LayoutBuilder` accomplishes a similar goal as
`MediaQuery.sizeOf`, with some distinctions.


Rather than providing the size of the app's window,
`LayoutBuilder` provides the layout constraints from
the parent `Widget`. This means that you get
sizing information based on the specific spot
in the widget tree where you added the `LayoutBuilder`.
Also, `LayoutBuilder` returns a `BoxConstraints`
object instead of a `Size` object,
so you are given the valid width
and height ranges (minimum and maximum) for the content,
rather than just a fixed size.
This can be useful for custom widgets.


For example, imagine a custom widget, where you want
the sizing to be based on the space specifically
given to that widget, and not the app window in general.
In this scenario, use `LayoutBuilder`.


## Step 3: Branch

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/adaptive-responsive/general#step-3-branch)

![Step 3: Branch the code based on the desired UI](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/branch.png)

At this point, you must decide what sizing breakpoints to use
when choosing what version of the UI to display.
For example, the [Material layout](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/applying-layout/window-size-classes)
guidelines suggest using
a bottom nav bar for windows less than 600 logical pixels wide,
and a nav rail for those that are 600 pixels wide or greater.
Again, your choice shouldn't depend on the _type_ of device,
but on the device's available window size.


To work through an example that switches between a
`NavigationRail` and a `NavigationBar`, check out
the [Building an animated responsive app layout with Material 3](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-animated-responsive-layout).


The next page discusses how to ensure that your
app looks best on large screens and foldables.

Check out our newly published best practices for [building AI-powered apps with Flutter!](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/best-practices)

How do you modify your app to make it react to user input?
In this tutorial, you'll add interactivity to an app that
contains only non-interactive widgets.
Specifically, you'll modify an icon to make it tappable
by creating a custom stateful widget that manages two
stateless widgets.


The [building layouts tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial) showed you how to create
the layout for the following screenshot.


![The layout tutorial app](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/lakes.jpg)

The layout tutorial app

When the app first launches, the star is solid red,
indicating that this lake has previously been favorited.
The number next to the star indicates that 41
people have favorited this lake. After completing this tutorial,
tapping the star removes its favorited status,
replacing the solid star with an outline and
decreasing the count. Tapping again favorites the lake,
drawing a solid star and increasing the count.


![The custom widget you'll create](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/favorited-not-favorited.png)

To accomplish this, you'll create a single custom widget
that includes both the star and the count,
which are themselves widgets. Tapping the star changes state
for both widgets, so the same widget should manage both.

[Step 2: Subclass StatefulWidget](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#step-2).

skip to [Managing state](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#managing-state).


## Stateful and stateless widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#stateful-and-stateless-widgets)

A widget is either stateful or stateless. If a widget can
change—when a user interacts with it,
for example—it's stateful.


A _stateless_ widget never changes.
[`Icon`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Icon-class.html),
[`IconButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html), and
[`Text`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Text-class.html) are
examples of stateless widgets. Stateless widgets
subclass [`StatelessWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html).


A _stateful_ widget is dynamic: for example,
it can change its appearance in response to events
triggered by user interactions or when it receives data.
[`Checkbox`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Checkbox-class.html),
[`Radio`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Radio-class.html), [`Slider`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Slider-class.html),
[`InkWell`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/InkWell-class.html),
[`Form`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Form-class.html), and [`TextField`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html)

are examples of stateful widgets. Stateful widgets
subclass [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html).


A widget's state is stored in a [`State`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html)
object,
separating the widget's state from its appearance.
The state consists of values that can change, like a
slider's current value or whether a checkbox is checked.
When the widget's state changes,
the state object calls `setState()`,
telling the framework to redraw the widget.


## Creating a stateful widget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#creating-a-stateful-widget)

In this section, you'll create a custom stateful widget.
You'll replace two stateless widgets—the solid red
star and the numeric count next to it—with a single
custom stateful widget that manages a row with two
children widgets: an `IconButton` and `Text`.


Implementing a custom stateful widget requires creating two classes:

- A subclass of `StatefulWidget` that defines the widget.
- A subclass of `State` that contains the state for that
widget and defines the widget's `build()` method.


This section shows you how to build a stateful widget,
called `FavoriteWidget`, for the lakes app.
After setting up, your first step is choosing how state is
managed for `FavoriteWidget`.


### Step 0: Get ready

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#step-0-get-ready)

If you've already built the app in the
[building layouts tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial),
skip to the next section.


1. Make sure you've [set up](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started) your environment.
2. [Create a new Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/create-new-app).
3. Replace the `lib/main.dart` file with [`main.dart`](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/examples/layout/lakes/step6/lib/main.dart).

4. Replace the `pubspec.yaml` file with [`pubspec.yaml`](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/examples/layout/lakes/step6/pubspec.yaml).

5. Create an `images` directory in your project, and add
    [`lake.jpg`](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/examples/layout/lakes/step6/images/lake.jpg).


Once you have a connected and enabled device,
or you've launched the [iOS simulator](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/setup#set-up-devices)

(part of the Flutter install) or the
[Android emulator](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/android/setup#set-up-devices) (part of the Android Studio
install), you are good to go!


### Step 1: Decide which object manages the widget's state

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#step-1-decide-which-object-manages-the-widgets-state)

A widget's state can be managed in several ways,
but in our example the widget itself,
`FavoriteWidget`, will manage its own state.
In this example, toggling the star is an isolated
action that doesn't affect the parent widget or the rest of
the UI, so the widget can handle its state internally.


Learn more about the separation of widget and state,
and how state might be managed, in [Managing state](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#managing-state).


### Step 2: Subclass StatefulWidget

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#step-2-subclass-statefulwidget)

The `FavoriteWidget` class manages its own state,
so it overrides `createState()` to create a `State`
object. The framework calls `createState()`
when it wants to build the widget.
In this example, `createState()` returns an
instance of `_FavoriteWidgetState`,
which you'll implement in the next step.


dart

```
class FavoriteWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const FavoriteWidget({super.key});
​
  @override
  State<FavoriteWidget> createState() => _FavoriteWidgetState();
}
```

content\_copy

### Step 3: Subclass State

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#step-3-subclass-state)

The `_FavoriteWidgetState` class stores the mutable data
that can change over the lifetime of the widget.
When the app first launches, the UI displays a solid
red star, indicating that the lake has "favorite" status,
along with 41 likes. These values are stored in the
`_isFavorited` and `_favoriteCount` fields:


dart

```
class _FavoriteWidgetState extends State<FavoriteWidget> {
  bool _isFavorited = true;
  int _favoriteCount = 41;
```

content\_copy

The class also defines a `build()` method,
which creates a row containing a red `IconButton`,
and `Text`. You use [`IconButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html)
(instead of `Icon`)
because it has an `onPressed` property that defines
the callback function (`_toggleFavorite`) for handling a tap.
You'll define the callback function next.


dart

```
class _FavoriteWidgetState extends State<FavoriteWidget> {
  // ···
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
      children: [\
        Container(\
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(0),\
          child: IconButton(\
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(0),\
            alignment: Alignment.center,\
            icon: (_isFavorited\
                ? const Icon(Icons.star)\
                : const Icon(Icons.star_border)),\
            color: Colors.red[500],\
            onPressed: _toggleFavorite,\
          ),\
        ),\
        SizedBox(width: 18, child: SizedBox(child: Text('$_favoriteCount'))),\
      ],
    );
  }
​
  // ···
}
```

content\_copy

The `_toggleFavorite()` method, which is called when the
`IconButton` is pressed, calls `setState()`.
Calling `setState()` is critical, because this
tells the framework that the widget's state has
changed and that the widget should be redrawn.
The function argument to `setState()` toggles the
UI between these two states:


- A `star` icon and the number 41
- A `star_border` icon and the number 40

dart

```
void _toggleFavorite() {
  setState(() {
    if (_isFavorited) {
      _favoriteCount -= 1;
      _isFavorited = false;
    } else {
      _favoriteCount += 1;
      _isFavorited = true;
    }
  });
}
```

content\_copy

### Step 4: Plug the stateful widget into the widget tree

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#step-4-plug-the-stateful-widget-into-the-widget-tree)

Add your custom stateful widget to the widget tree in
the app's `build()` method. First, locate the code that
creates the `Icon` and `Text`, and delete it.
In the same location, create the stateful widget:


dart

```
child: Row(
  children: [\
    // ...\
    Icon(\
      Icons.star,\
      color: Colors.red[500],\
    ),\
    const Text('41'),\
    const FavoriteWidget(),\
  ],
),
```

content\_copy

That's it! When you hot reload the app,
the star icon should now respond to taps.


### Problems?

The rest of this page covers several ways a widget's state can
be managed, and lists other available interactive widgets.


## Managing state

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#managing-state)

Who manages the stateful widget's state? The widget itself?
The parent widget? Both? Another object?
The answer is... it depends. There are several valid ways
to make your widget interactive. You, as the widget designer,
make the decision based on how you expect your widget to be used.
Here are the most common ways to manage state:


- [The widget manages its own state](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#self-managed)
- [The parent manages the widget's state](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#parent-managed)
- [A mix-and-match approach](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#mix-and-match)

How do you decide which approach to use?
The following principles should help you decide:


- If the state in question is user data,
for example the checked or unchecked
mode of a checkbox, or the position of a slider,
then the state is best managed by the parent widget.

- If the state in question is aesthetic,
for example an animation, then the
state is best managed by the widget itself.


If in doubt, start by managing state in the parent widget.

We'll give examples of the different ways of managing state
by creating three simple examples: TapboxA, TapboxB,
and TapboxC. The examples all work similarly—each
creates a container that, when tapped, toggles between a
green or grey box. The `_active` boolean determines the
color: green for active or grey for inactive.


![Active state](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/tapbox-active-state.png)![Inactive state](https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/tapbox-inactive-state.png)

These examples use [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
to capture activity
on the `Container`.


### The widget manages its own state

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#the-widget-manages-its-own-state)

Sometimes it makes the most sense for the widget
to manage its state internally. For example,
[`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html)
automatically scrolls when its
content exceeds the render box. Most developers
using `ListView` don't want to manage `ListView`'s
scrolling behavior, so `ListView` itself manages its scroll offset.


The `_TapboxAState` class:

- Manages state for `TapboxA`.
- Defines the `_active` boolean which determines the
box's current color.

- Defines the `_handleTap()` function, which updates
`_active` when the box is tapped and calls the
`setState()` function to update the UI.

- Implements all interactive behavior for the widget.

dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
// TapboxA manages its own state.
​
//------------------------- TapboxA ----------------------------------
​
class TapboxA extends StatefulWidget {
  const TapboxA({super.key});
​
  @override
  State<TapboxA> createState() => _TapboxAState();
}
​
class _TapboxAState extends State<TapboxA> {
  bool _active = false;
​
  void _handleTap() {
    setState(() {
      _active = !_active;
    });
  }
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: _handleTap,
      child: Container(
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: _active ? Colors.lightGreen[700] : Colors.grey[600],
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            _active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
            style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 32, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
​
//------------------------- MyApp ----------------------------------
​
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Flutter Demo')),
        body: const Center(child: TapboxA()),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### The parent widget manages the widget's state

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#the-parent-widget-manages-the-widgets-state)

Often it makes the most sense for the parent widget
to manage the state and tell its child widget when to update.
For example, [`IconButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/IconButton-class.html)
allows you to treat
an icon as a tappable button. `IconButton` is a
stateless widget because we decided that the parent
widget needs to know whether the button has been tapped,
so it can take appropriate action.


In the following example, TapboxB exports its state
to its parent through a callback. Because TapboxB
doesn't manage any state, it subclasses StatelessWidget.


The ParentWidgetState class:

- Manages the `_active` state for TapboxB.
- Implements `_handleTapboxChanged()`,
the method called when the box is tapped.

- When the state changes, calls `setState()`
to update the UI.


The TapboxB class:

- Extends StatelessWidget because all state is handled by its parent.
- When a tap is detected, it notifies the parent.

dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
// ParentWidget manages the state for TapboxB.
​
//------------------------ ParentWidget --------------------------------
​
class ParentWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const ParentWidget({super.key});
​
  @override
  State<ParentWidget> createState() => _ParentWidgetState();
}
​
class _ParentWidgetState extends State<ParentWidget> {
  bool _active = false;
​
  void _handleTapboxChanged(bool newValue) {
    setState(() {
      _active = newValue;
    });
  }
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SizedBox(
      child: TapboxB(active: _active, onChanged: _handleTapboxChanged),
    );
  }
}
​
//------------------------- TapboxB ----------------------------------
​
class TapboxB extends StatelessWidget {
  const TapboxB({super.key, this.active = false, required this.onChanged});
​
  final bool active;
  final ValueChanged<bool> onChanged;
​
  void _handleTap() {
    onChanged(!active);
  }
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: _handleTap,
      child: Container(
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: active ? Colors.lightGreen[700] : Colors.grey[600],
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
            style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 32, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### A mix-and-match approach

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#a-mix-and-match-approach)

For some widgets, a mix-and-match approach makes
the most sense. In this scenario, the stateful widget
manages some of the state, and the parent widget
manages other aspects of the state.


In the `TapboxC` example, on tap down,
a dark green border appears around the box. On tap up,
the border disappears and the box's color changes. `TapboxC`
exports its `_active` state to its parent but manages its
`_highlight` state internally. This example has two `State`
objects, `_ParentWidgetState` and `_TapboxCState`.


The `_ParentWidgetState` object:

- Manages the `_active` state.
- Implements `_handleTapboxChanged()`,
the method called when the box is tapped.

- Calls `setState()` to update the UI when a tap
occurs and the `_active` state changes.


The `_TapboxCState` object:

- Manages the `_highlight` state.
- The `GestureDetector` listens to all tap events.
As the user taps down, it adds the highlight
(implemented as a dark green border). As the user releases the
tap, it removes the highlight.

- Calls `setState()` to update the UI on tap down,
tap up, or tap cancel, and the `_highlight` state changes.

- On a tap event, passes that state change to the parent widget to take
appropriate action using the [`widget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/widget.html)
property.


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
//---------------------------- ParentWidget ----------------------------
​
class ParentWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const ParentWidget({super.key});
​
  @override
  State<ParentWidget> createState() => _ParentWidgetState();
}
​
class _ParentWidgetState extends State<ParentWidget> {
  bool _active = false;
​
  void _handleTapboxChanged(bool newValue) {
    setState(() {
      _active = newValue;
    });
  }
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SizedBox(
      child: TapboxC(active: _active, onChanged: _handleTapboxChanged),
    );
  }
}
​
//----------------------------- TapboxC ------------------------------
​
class TapboxC extends StatefulWidget {
  const TapboxC({super.key, this.active = false, required this.onChanged});
​
  final bool active;
  final ValueChanged<bool> onChanged;
​
  @override
  State<TapboxC> createState() => _TapboxCState();
}
​
class _TapboxCState extends State<TapboxC> {
  bool _highlight = false;
​
  void _handleTapDown(TapDownDetails details) {
    setState(() {
      _highlight = true;
    });
  }
​
  void _handleTapUp(TapUpDetails details) {
    setState(() {
      _highlight = false;
    });
  }
​
  void _handleTapCancel() {
    setState(() {
      _highlight = false;
    });
  }
​
  void _handleTap() {
    widget.onChanged(!widget.active);
  }
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // This example adds a green border on tap down.
    // On tap up, the square changes to the opposite state.
    return GestureDetector(
      onTapDown: _handleTapDown, // Handle the tap events in the order that
      onTapUp: _handleTapUp, // they occur: down, up, tap, cancel
      onTap: _handleTap,
      onTapCancel: _handleTapCancel,
      child: Container(
        width: 200,
        height: 200,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: widget.active ? Colors.lightGreen[700] : Colors.grey[600],
          border: _highlight
              ? Border.all(color: Colors.teal[700]!, width: 10)
              : null,
        ),
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            widget.active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
            style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 32, color: Colors.white),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

An alternate implementation might have exported the highlight
state to the parent while keeping the active state internal,
but if you asked someone to use that tap box,
they'd probably complain that it doesn't make much sense.
The developer cares whether the box is active.
The developer probably doesn't care how the highlighting
is managed, and prefers that the tap box handles those
details.

## Other interactive widgets

[#](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#other-interactive-widgets)

Flutter offers a variety of buttons and similar interactive widgets.
Most of these widgets implement the [Material Design guidelines](https://m3.material.io/styles),
which define a set of components with an opinionated UI.


If you prefer, you can use [`GestureDetector`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html)
to build
interactivity into any custom widget.
You can find examples of `GestureDetector` in
[Managing state](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/interactivity#managing-state). Learn more about the `GestureDetector`

in [Handle taps](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/gestures/handling-taps), a recipe in the Flutter cookbook.


When you need interactivity, it's easiest to use one of
the prefabricated widgets. Here's a partial list:


### Standard widgets
