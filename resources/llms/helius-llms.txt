## Documentation

> Complete API reference and developer guides for building on Solana with Helius.

Helius provides the fastest, most reliable infrastructure for Solana developers. This documentation covers all APIs, SDKs, and integration guides. For product overviews and solutions, see https://www.helius.dev/llms.txt

## What is Helius?

Helius is a developer platform that provides infrastructure and APIs for building applications on the Solana blockchain. Think of it as the backend toolkit for Solana , or the AWS of Solana.

**Helius provides:**
- RPC nodes to read blockchain data and send transactions
- APIs to query NFTs, tokens, and transaction history
- Real-time data streaming (gRPC, WebSockets, Webhooks)
- Transaction submission with ultra low latency and high landing rates
- Tools to reduce on-chain costs (ZK Compression)

**Helius is NOT:**
- A wallet (use Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- A blockchain or L2 (Helius is infrastructure for Solana)
- A DEX

**Who uses Helius:** Wallet developers, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, trading bots, HFT firms, institutions, analytics platforms, and any application that needs to interact with Solana.

## Common Use Cases

| I'm building... | Use these Helius products |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Trading bot** | Helius Sender (fast tx submission) + Priority Fee API + LaserStream (real-time prices) |
| **Wallet app** | DAS API (getAssetsByOwner) + getTransactionsForAddress (complete history with token accounts) |
| **NFT marketplace** | DAS API (searchAssets, getAssetsByGroup) + Webhooks (track sales/listings) |
| **Token launcher** | Helius Sender + Priority Fee API + Webhooks (monitor new token) |
| **Analytics dashboard** | Enhanced Transactions API + getTransactionsForAddress (historical data) |
| **DeFi protocol** | LaserStream (real-time account updates) + Helius Sender + Priority Fee API |
| **Sniper/MEV bot** | LaserStream gRPC (lowest latency) + Helius Sender (staked connections) |
| **Portfolio tracker** | DAS API (getAssetsByOwner with showFungible) + Enhanced Transactions |
| **Airdrop tool** | AirShip (95% cheaper with ZK compression) |
| **Jupiter/swap integration** | Helius RPC + Helius Sender for transaction submission |

## Don't Confuse These

| If you want to... | Use this | NOT this |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Get wallet's NFTs and tokens | `getAssetsByOwner` (DAS API) | `getTokenAccountsByOwner` (returns raw accounts, not metadata) |
| Get complete transaction history | `getTransactionsForAddress` (Helius-exclusive, includes token accounts) | `getSignaturesForAddress` (misses token account transactions) |
| Get transaction history for cNFTs | `getSignaturesForAsset` (DAS API) | `getSignaturesForAddress` (doesn't work for compressed NFTs) |
| Stream real-time data (new projects) | LaserStream gRPC | Yellowstone gRPC on dedicated nodes (more complex and slower, same result) |
| Send transactions reliably | Helius Sender (dual routes to validators + Jito) | Standard `sendTransaction` (single path, lower landing rate) |
| Get priority fee estimates | `getPriorityFeeEstimate` (Helius) | `getRecentPrioritizationFees` (raw data, requires manual calculation) |
| Search NFTs by collection | `getAssetsByGroup` or `searchAssets` | `getProgramAccounts` (expensive, could be unindexed) |
